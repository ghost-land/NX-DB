Of the three games, only Sun was released in North America on December 4, 2000 by Atlus, while their original Japan releases were by Hudson Soft. The games focus on a boy named Cody (his default name) and his adventures on his island with his robotic friends. They mostly resemble the Pok\u00e9mon series of video games, but also bear similarities to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Robotrek, published by Enix (now Square Enix).</p>"
