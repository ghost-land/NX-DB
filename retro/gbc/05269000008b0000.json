    "description": "<p>Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko (titled Gex: Deep Pocket Gecko on Game Boy Color) is a platform video game. It is the third and final installment of the Gex video game series. Danny John-Jules provided the voice for Gex in the UK and European release and comedian Dana Gould reprised the role for the American release, also starring the Playboy model Marliece Andrada as Agent Xtra, the only character that is featured in live-action. Unlike the first two Gex games, passwords are not used for saving (except in the Game Boy Color version). A controller pak on the Nintendo 64 or a memory card on the PlayStation were the only options for saving. The N64 version features small amounts of live action FMV sequences featuring Agent Xtra.</p>"
