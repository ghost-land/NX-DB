    "description": "<p>Power Quest, known in Japan as Gekit\u014d Power Modeler (Japanese: \u6fc0\u95d8\u30d1\u30ef\u30fc\u30e2\u30c7\u30e9\u30fc), is an RPG-based fighting video game developed by Japan System Supply for the Game Boy Color. It was published in Japan by Capcom on November 27, 1998, and published in North America by Sunsoft in December 1998. It later received a limited European release in July 1999.</p>\n<p>In the game, a new craze has hit the town: fighting with model robots. The player walks around the town as the main character, but takes control of the model robot during fights. There are six robot models available, each with different stats and special moves. The models are Max, Gong, Axe, Speed, Lon and Borot. Over time, the player earns credits and buys parts to improve their model. In addition to the story mode, there is a simple versus mode that allows the player to fight immediately.</p>"
