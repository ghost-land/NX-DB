    "description": "<p>Keitai Denjuu Telefang 2 is the sequel to the first Telefang game for the Game Boy Advance. Taking place in a different part of the Denjuu world from the first one, this game shares some qualities with Telefang 1. The battle system is similar, as is the gathering-phone-numbers system, but a good deal of things are quite different from the original. Limited-edition versions of the game included a peripheral called the Power Antenna.</p>"
