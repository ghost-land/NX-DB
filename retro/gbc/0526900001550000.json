    "description": "<p>TimeSplitters: Future Perfect is a 2005 first-person shooter video game developed by Free Radical Design and published by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation 2, GameCube and Xbox video game consoles.<br />\nIt is the third game in the TimeSplitters series, following TimeSplitters (2000) and TimeSplitters 2 (2002). The game features a single-player mode consisting of levels where the player assumes the role of Sergeant Cortez, a time-traveling marine from the 25th century, as he attempts to go to the past to save the future. The game also includes a range of multiplayer options including cooperative mode. Online play was included in both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox versions.<br />\nIn June 2007, a sequel was announced to be in development, titled TimeSplitters 4, but has since been shelved due to difficulties selling the idea to potential publishers based on Future Perfect&#39;s sales performance.</p>"
