    "description": "<p>\n      Genie-girl Shantae is the self-appointed guardian of a small fishing \n      village, Scuttle Town. Living life in a lighthouse rather than a bottle, \n      she's constantly on the lookout for danger. When the nefarious \n      lady-pirate, Risky Boots catches wind of the treasure that was recently \n      unearthed in the village, she launches an attack. To get Scuttle out of \n      trouble, it's up to Shantae to prove that she's the rightful \"Guardian \n      Genie\" to the best of her dancing, buying and hair-whipping abilities. \n      Learn \"Dance Magic\" to get new attacks, and battle your way through over \n      50 locations and Mini-Games!\n    </p>"
