    "description": "<p>WWF WrestleMania 2000 is a professional wrestling video game originally released in 1999 on the Nintendo 64 (N64) console. It was based on the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) annual pay-per-view, WrestleMania. Despite the fact that this game is based upon Wrestlemania 2000, the game was released five months prior (and four months prior on the Game Boy Color), to the actual PPV itself, therefore resulting in using the stage design from the previous event, WrestleMania XV, instead. Released at the height of the WWF's Attitude Era, WrestleMania 2000 was the first WWF game released by THQ. The wrestling company ended its long relationship with Acclaim Entertainment after witnessing the video game success of its competitor, World Championship Wrestling (WCW), on behalf of THQ. WrestleMania 2000 shares its game engine with the Japan-only release Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: \u014cd\u014d Keish\u014d.</p>\n<p>The game would be succeeded by WWF No Mercy in 2000.</p>"
