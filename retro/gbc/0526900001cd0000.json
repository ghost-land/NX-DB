    "description": "<p>Top Gear Pocket is racing video game where the player drives rally cars through a series of tracks. As the player wins races, new cars and tracks are unlocked. The game features a total of 14 cars and eight tracks. Races can take place in cities, savannas, grasslands, and snowy trails. Both two-wheeled and four-wheeled cars are featured in the game and the handling of each car varies signifficantly. The game cartridge features a built-in rumble feature that vibrates when the player crashes into other cars or slides on the track, but does not feature a battery to save the game progress, so passwords must be used to restore the game to a specific state. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where two players can race against each other. The Game Link Cable is required for multiplayer</p>"
