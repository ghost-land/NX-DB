    "description": "<p>Pok\u00e9mon Pinball (Japanese: \u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30d4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb, Hepburn: Pokemon Pinb\u014dru) is a pinball-based Pok\u00e9mon spin-off video game for the Game Boy Color. It was released in Japan on April 14, 1999, and in North America on June 28, 1999. In it, the ball is a Pok\u00e9 Ball, and most of the objects on the table are Pok\u00e9mon-related.<br />\nLike any pinball game, the main objective is to get points, using the different modes of advances to score them at a higher rate. Pok\u00e9mon Pinball has a secondary objective hinted at by the tagline &quot;Gotta Catch &#39;em All,&quot; which is to collect all 151 Pok\u00e9mon to fill your Pok\u00e9dex. The Pok\u00e9dex is saved between individual games, so it can be built up over time.</p>"
