    "description": "<p>Since bashing the evil Buttsville Queen in a Game Boy adventure and eliminating Psycrow on the Super NES back in 1995, Earthworm Jim has enjoyed a quiet life of leisure. We tried to guess how he&#39;s been spending the last four years, but we quickly realized that some things are better left unexplained.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Jim, his paid vacation time has just run out. The courageous annelid made the move to the third dimension in Earthworm Jim 3D, but it&#39;s side-scrolling platform work as usual for Jim on Game Boy Color.</p>\n<p>In Menace 2 the Galaxy, Jim must jump and shoot his way through 12 perilous levels, including a frightening tour of Jim&#39;s own bedroom. There&#39;s not much of a storyline to get in the way, but classic Jimonian humor rears its ugly head from time to time. Speaking of which, Professor Monkey-for-a-Head is back in action as well.</p>\n<p>Play control doesn&#39;t stand up well next to his 16-bit hits, but Jim gets around fairly well in Menace 2 the Galaxy. Colorful graphics create an appealing visual package, with detailed backgrounds and interesting enemies.</p>\n<p>Earthworm Jim: Menace 2 the Galaxy is compatible with Game Boy Pocket and the original Game Boy as well as Game Boy Color.</p>"
