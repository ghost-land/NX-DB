    "description": "<p>Conker&#39;s Pocket Tales is a platform video game developed and published by Rare and released on June 8, 1999 for the Game Boy Color. The cartridge is dual-format, allowing it to also run on the original Game Boy with some gameplay differences. The game is the first in a series to star Conker the Squirrel after he initially appeared as a playable character in Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64. It is the only one to feature Conker in a lighthearted and family friendly game, whereas his later games (Conker&#39;s Bad Fur Day and Conker: Live &amp; Reloaded) would contrastingly be adult-oriented.</p>"
