    "description": "<p>\u201cMemory is an oddly circuitous thing, often dancing in its own circles. A snake perpetually eating its own tail. We can sometimes swear we\u2019ve seen something before, in another life. Echoes of another existence, so familiar and yet\u2026we\u2019ve never been here before, have we?\u201d<br />\nA man embarks on a journey toward the top of a mountain, to discover the truth of his existence. Along the way, he ponders the nature of life itself. Drizzlepath: Deja Vu is a spiritual revisitation of Tongu\u00e7 Bodur&#39;s very first game, Drizzlepath. Not so much a remake as a re-envisioning, as well as a celebration of the many games he has made since.<br />\nA relaxing \u201cwalking simulator\u201d, in which events are triggered not through interaction with objects, but through exploring<br />\nTongu\u00e7 Bodur\u2019s tenth game on Steam, and a homage to his very first game from 2015<br />\nNeither a sequel nor a remake, but a standalone experience with bonus in-references for those familiar with his earlier games<br />\nProfessional voice narration, atmospheric sound design, and a dynamic music score<br />\nA playtime of thirty to sixty minutes, with a thorough playthrough required to discover all of the game\u2019s secrets<br />\nA single sprawling level, broken up into several save points<br />\nA rich and thought-provoking narrative, co-written by Bottle: Pilgrim and Nephise: Ascension author Michael Bowser</p>"
