    "description": "<p>International Superstar Soccer 2000 (officially abbreviated as ISS 2000 and released in Japan as Jikkyo J-League 1999: Perfect Striker 2 for the Nintendo 64 and as World Soccer GB 2000 for the Game Boy Color in Japan) is the second game in the Nintendo 64 Perfect Striker series and the last in Konami's Jikkyo Soccer series of N64 games developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka. For the North American and European release in 2000 the rosters were updated. Introduced in the North American and European versions, it was the first and only game in the series to support the high resolution mode through an expansion pack however it suffered from some performance issues.</p>\n<p>ISS 2000 is also notable for being the only game in the series which included players with real names, though these players only appeared in the North American release, and no team had a 100% real roster.</p>"
