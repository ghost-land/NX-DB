    "description": "<p>Take on the role of either Roddy or Cathy, bounty hunters in this<br />\nside-scrolling action game set far in the future when humans have<br />\ncolonized space. But all is not well: Space pirates called the Klaptons<br />\nare making their way through the galaxies, wiping out peaceful<br />\nsettlements along their path. This disgraceful behavior leads to them<br />\nhaving a price on their heads, so now Roddy and Cathy must travel<br />\nthrough four distinct worlds on a mission to defeat their leader,<br />\nCaptain Klapton. Both characters have retractable arms-used to grab<br />\nenemies or other objects in the scenery-that can then be thrown at<br />\nothers to destroy them. Also, be on the lookout for rings or levers to<br />\npull, as this might reveal special bonuses. Further adding to the mix,<br />\nthe game uses a unique system where the action happens on two planes,<br />\nwith the player switching between them at will. Can you prove yourself<br />\nworthy of the Top Hunter name and help save the universe?</p>"
