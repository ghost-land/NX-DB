    "description": "<p>As the first game in the long-running King of Fighters series, The King<br />\nof Fighters \u201994 brought together popular characters from other<br />\nwell-known franchises and pitted them against each other. Match warriors<br />\nfrom Fatal Fury against favorites from its sister series, Art of<br />\nFighting. Or see if the casts of the Ikari Warriors and Psycho Soldier<br />\nseries better suit your fighting style. Plus, there\u2019s a set of brand-<br />\nnew characters, exclusive to the KOF series, that are willing to join<br />\nthe fray. But there\u2019s a twist\u2014instead of the standard best best-two-<br />\nout- of- three- rounds fight setup, players choose one of eight teams,<br />\neach made up of three teammates. To win, all members of the other team<br />\nmust be eliminated before your fighters are knocked out. Use the game\u2019s<br />\npower gauge to inflict maximum damage and end the round with a<br />\ndevastating finishing move. It\u2019s a battle royal unlike anything else\u2014a<br />\ngame whose inspiration is easily seen in the fighting games that<br />\nfollowed it. Can your team be the last one standing?<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
