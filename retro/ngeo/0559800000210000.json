    "description": "<p>Crossed Swords is a hack &amp; slash action RPG arcade game developed by Alpha Denshi and published by SNK. It was released for the Neo Geo arcade system in July 1991 and later on Neo Geo console in October of the same year. Its gameplay was similar to SNK&#39;s earlier 1990 first-person shooter and beat &#39;em up game, The Super Spy, but with role-playing game elements and hack &amp; slash combat instead of shooting and fist-fighting.</p>"
