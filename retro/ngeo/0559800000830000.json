    "description": "<p>METAL SLUG 3 is a game in the shoot &#39;em up genre, a sequel to the METAL SLUG 2/METAL SLUG X and overall a third installment in the series. Initially released for arcade platform, the game shares gameplay mechanics with its predecessors, where the player takes control of a squad of four soldiers and faces continuous waves of enemies throughout each level.<br />\nThe game\u2019s plot follows the previous events, where the main characters succeeded in overthrowing a maniac and bringing relative peace. This time, however, it is revealed that our heroes&#39; nemesis is back for more, with new allies and new soldiers to try and stop the protagonists. As the levels progress, the player faces different enemies, each with unique patterns and abilities, and also finds new weapons and upgrades for his character of choice. Another feature of the series is its vehicles, including tanks, planes, helicopters and even a spaceship. Each of those can be used to the various extent and provide significant bonuses to character\u2019s firepower, defense, or movement capabilities.<br />\nThe game is made using pixel graphics, and even though it was initially released in 2000, the sceneries and the details are still as stunning. Each character\u2019s looks are refined, explosions are made colorful and as realistic for a 2D game as possible, and the locations themselves would look like art.</p>"
