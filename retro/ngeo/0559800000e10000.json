    "description": "SOCCER BRAWL is a soccer game released by SNK in 1992. Sparks fly as teams representing 8 different countries battle for the championship. Staged in the near future, teams feature 7 robot players instead of the normal 11 players, allowing the defence to also go on the attack and for a variety of arrangements."
