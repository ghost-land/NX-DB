    "description": "<p>Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior, originally released in Japan as Ryuuko no Ken Gaiden (\u9f8d\u864e\u308a\u3085\u3046\u3053\u306e\u62f3\u3051\u3093 \u5916\u4f1d\u304c\u3044\u3067\u3093), is the third and final entry in the Art of Fighting series. The game cast is almost all composed of new characters, excepting for Robert Garcia and Ryo Sakazaki. Yuri Sakazaki also appears in the game, but as a non-playable character.</p>\n<p>One of the game&#39;s biggest selling points was the game&#39;s motion capturing system, allowing 2D sprites with fluid and believable animations. It is one of the few games that also doesn&#39;t have an arcade perfect transition for the Neo Geo CD, as it has slightly shrunken sprites and different shades of the color palette. However, it also featured voiced win quotes for each character and endings for Sinclair and Wyler.</p>\n<p>This game is also the only one in the series to have a short CD dram</p>"
