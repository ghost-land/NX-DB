    "description": "<p>Released in 1990 and one of the NEOGEO\u2019s earliest signature games, this<br />\nside-scrolling platformer mixes action with the mystical world of<br />\nfantasy. A magician named Elta, last descendant of the famed Magician<br />\nLord, takes on an epic adventure to save the world from the evil<br />\nGul-Agieze. Elta must battle through eight stages, collecting the eight<br />\ntomes of power that are the key to defeating Gul-Agieze and his evil<br />\nplans. By obtaining orbs in one of three colors (elements) that appear<br />\nduring the progress of the game, Elta\u2019s offensive powers and jumping<br />\nabilities can be strengthened. The effect varies considerably depending<br />\non the combination of elements though, and Elta can transform into six<br />\ndifferent forms (Waterman, Dragon Warrior, Shinobi, Samurai, Raijin, or<br />\nPoseidon). Can you help Elta to become the new Magician Lord?<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
