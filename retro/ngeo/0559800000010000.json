    "description": "<p>Originally released in 1991, this is not your typical baseball game. In<br />\nthe near future, there are two leagues with a total of 12 teams for<br />\nplayers to choose from. Pick your team and go for the championship. The<br />\ngames are held at the exclusive Cyber Egg Stadium, where the home run<br />\nzone is alarmingly small and the fair zone is unusually wide. There is<br />\neven a stop zone to stop any ball that lands there. As the game<br />\nprogresses Crackers (mines) are installed. During games, armor can be<br />\npurchased to reinforce your players. All this makes for a unique<br />\nbaseball experience. You may be a bit perplexed at first, but once you<br />\nget used to it and begin devising a strategy, you might even start<br />\nenjoying all the curveballs being thrown at you.<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. See more Virtual Console games for Wii.</p>"
