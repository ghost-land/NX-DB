If you line up three or more balloons of the same color in a<br />\nrow vertically, they will burst. Some balloons feature unique<br />\ncharacteristics. Special balloons, which come in all four colors, pop<br />\nevery balloon that share the same color as them. Arrow balloons burst<br />\neverything in the direction their arrow is facing. Rainbow balloons have<br />\nthe same effect as special balloons, but can be thrown against a balloon<br />\nof any color. And then there are bubble balloons, which simply get in<br />\nyour way. Together, these provide you with great chains and combos that<br />\nmake a puzzle game so much fun.
