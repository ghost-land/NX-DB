    "description": "After his victory against Kojiro, Musashi decided to meditate and try his hand at art, in the north of Japan, in the province of Hokkaido. During one of his meditations, a spirit contacted him : \"Miyamoto Musashi, our fight is not over, I am waiting for you to finish our fight once and for all! All of Japan will pay for your insult! I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!\u201d <br/><br/>There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojir\u014d\u2019s one. His body was defeated, but his spirit remains, and his intentions were destructive. Miyamoto Musashi then understood that he would have to travel across Japan from north to south and go to the island of Ganry\u00fb-jima, where he firstly defeated Sasaki Kojir\u014d, to fight again and liberate the spirit of Kojiro forever.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Ganryu 2 is a 2D platformer at its best!
