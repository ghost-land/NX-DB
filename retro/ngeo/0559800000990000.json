    "description": "<p>Mr. Do! (\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5, Misut\u0101 Du) is an arcade game created by Universal in 1982. Similar in some ways to Namco's popular Dig Dug title, Mr. Do! was also popular and saw release on a variety of home video game consoles and systems. It is the first game in the Mr. Do series, and was released both as a standalone game and as a conversion kit (released by Taito Corp.) for existing arcade cabinets. It was one of the first arcade games to be released as a conversion kit, and went on to sell 30,000 units in the United States. It was remade in Japan as Neo Mr. Do! (\u30cd\u30aa\u30df\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c9\u30a5, Neo Misut\u0101 Du). It was also a popular choice on the 1983 video arcade-based game show Starcade.</p>"
