    "description": "<p>Over Top[a] is a racing arcade video game developed by ADK and originally published by SNK on April 26, 1996. It is the spiritual successor to Thrash Rally, which was released earlier in 1991 on Neo Geo platforms.</p>\n<p>Themed around rallying, Over Top pits the players with competing against AI-controlled opponents in races across various locations. Directed by Magician Lord designer Takashi Egashira, the game was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at ADK. Though it was initially launched for the Neo Geo MVS (arcade), the title was later released for both Neo Geo AES (home) and Neo Geo CD respectively, in addition of being re-released through download services for various consoles.</p>\n<p>Over Top was received with mixed reception from critics and reviewers since its initial release.</p>"
