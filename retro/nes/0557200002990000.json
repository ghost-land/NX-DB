    "description": "<p>Hello Kitty World is a reskinned port of the Game Boy game Balloon Kid (which released as Balloon Fight GB via Nintendo Power kiosks in Japan), itself a sequel to the Famicom&#39;s Balloon Fight.</p>\n<p>Notably, the game does not have the Balloon Trip mode featured in its predecessors, nor does it credit Nintendo (though the &quot;Mario Co,Ltd&quot; listed on the title screen is probably an indirect nod).</p>"
