    "description": "<p>Slalom is a skiing video game in which the player races in a series of downhill slalom runs while navigating past flags and obstacles before time expires. It was developed by Rare and first released by Nintendo for the Nintendo VS. System in 1986. It was then released for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) in North America in March\u00a01987 and in Europe later that year. The game was developed by Tim and Chris Stamper and its music was composed by David Wise.</p>\n<p>Slalom was the first NES game developed outside Japan and the Stamper brothers' first game released under the Rare brand. Reviews from the 1980s found Slalom unrealistic, but largely appreciated its graphics and animations. In contrast, AllGame's retrospective review called the game poorly made and rushed. Slalom was released in Rare's 2015 Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One.</p>"
