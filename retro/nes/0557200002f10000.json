    "description": "<p>Journey to Silius, known in Japan as Rough World (\u30e9\u30d5\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9, Rafu W\u0101rudo, stylized as [r\u028cf] WORLD), is a side-scrolling run and gun video game developed and published by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990.<br />\nJourney to Silius was originally based on the 1984 film The Terminator, but the licensing rights to the film were lost during development. As a result, the graphics and storyline were altered to accommodate this change, but remnants of the earlier version still remain in the game. For example, the final boss has a striking resemblance to the titular Terminator in the film.</p>"
