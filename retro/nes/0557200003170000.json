    "description": "<p>Karnov (\u30ab\u30eb\u30ce\u30d5) is a 1987 platform arcade game. In the game, players take control of the title character Jinborov Karnovski (\u30b8\u30f3\u30dc\u30ed\u30d5\u30fb\u30ab\u30eb\u30ce\u30d5\u30b9\u30ad\u30fc), or \"Karnov\" for short. Karnov is a strongman popularly illustrated as being from an unspecified part of the Soviet Union's Central Asian republics as shown on the arcade flyer and again in Karnov's Revenge.</p>\n<p>As a character created by Data East, Karnov was reintroduced in several other games from the company, including Bad Dudes Vs. DragonNinja in which he is a boss in the first level. Karnov later appeared in the 1994 Neo-Geo game Karnov's Revenge. This game, also known as Fighter's History Dynamite, is not a sequel to the original Karnov, but to Fighter's History, a competitive one-on-one fighter in which Karnov is the final boss.</p>"
