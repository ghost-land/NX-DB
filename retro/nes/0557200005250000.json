    "description": "<p>Rock'n' Ball, released in Japan as Family Pinball (\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc\u30d4\u30f3\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb), is a Family Computer video game that was originally released in 1989. The video game was released in both Japan and North America. In the North American version, fictional human characters are used instead of the licensed Namco characters; four male characters and two female characters are at the player's disposal.</p>\n<p>Compared to the North American version, the bumpers in the Japanese version are separately further and the players have more room to guide their ball around the playing surface. The Japanese version has a higher overall difficulty compared to the North American version despite the latter having bigger arches.</p>"
