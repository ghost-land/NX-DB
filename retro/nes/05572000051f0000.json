    "description": "<p>Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves is a console game released in 1991 for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy developed by Sculptured Software, Inc. and Bits Studios, respectively, and published by Virgin Games, Inc. It was based on the film of the same name.<br />\nThe game was featured as the cover game for the July 1991 issue of Nintendo Power magazine. However, this issue was notorious for the fact that the game was not released until 6 months after the issue was released.<br />\nAround the same time, a Robin Hood game was also featured in an episode of Captain N: The Game Master. The episode was almost certainly a reference to Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves because it was the only Robin Hood game released for the NES in the relevant time frame, but none of the characters ever make a reference to the Prince of Thieves subtitle, possibly due to rights issues. Also, none of the Robin Hood characters in the episode resemble their counterparts from the film. As a result, the episode only vaguely alludes to the actual game.</p>"
