    "description": "<p>Toki, known in Japan as JuJu Densetsu (JuJu\u4f1d\u8aac) is a 1989 shoot 'em up platformer arcade game, or a \"run and gun\" developed and published in Japan by TAD Corporation and published in North America by Fabtek. It was designed by Akira Sakuma and features elements of tongue-in-cheek humor combined with the action. The player takes control of an enchanted ape who must battle hordes of jungle monsters with energy balls from his mouth. The ultimate goal is to destroy the evil wizard who cast a spell on the title protagonist; thereby transforming him from an ape back into a human, and rescuing the kidnapped princess. The game was ported to several video game consoles and home computers.</p>"
