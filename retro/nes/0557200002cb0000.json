    "description": "<p>International Cricket is a cricket video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It was developed by Melbourne based Beam Software and published under their Laser Beam Entertainment publishing arm in 1992. Aussie Rules Footy shares the same presentation style as this game. Like Aussie Rules Footy, the game was distributed exclusively by Mattel's Australian operation.</p>\n<p>There were no attempts to release a cricket video game to the North American, Japanese, or European markets. The reason is that baseball games dominated the North American and Japanese markets while soccer dominated the European market during that era. Two buttons are used to control the action; one for hitting the cricket ball while the other allows the player to slog around.</p>\n<p>One of the shortcomings in the game is the simple AI; the average player can bowl the computer out for totals not exceeding 20. Some of the other poor features in the game are the unrealistically green grass and the uninspired music found in the menu screens.</p>"
