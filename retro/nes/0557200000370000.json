Throughout this experience, you will get to learn the key parts of Yamato's life as well as travel to iconic landmarks such as the Ise Shrine and Mount Ibuki. This project is a school project that has been created by myself in the span of roughly 6 months. Everything was made by me except for music/audio, some of the animations (provided by mixamo.com), as well as the main font used for the game.</p>"
