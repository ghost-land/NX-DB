In this game, players drive a Ferrari 328 or an F1 racing machine through a race course.</p>\n<p>The game was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America and Europe months after its debut on Family Computer. The game was part of an attempt by Square to make 3-D games, and was followed by several other games using the same technology.</p>\n<p>The game sold almost 2 million copies, and is considered one of the best racing games on the NES, but was also criticized as being derivative of other racing games from the period.</p>"
