    "description": "<p>Sequel to the 2014 Game of the Year award winning &quot;The Fall&quot;.<br />\nA lone AI has experienced a system collapse after encountering the limits of her narrow set of rules. Now, deconstructed and injected with a dark, invasive process, she must take to the global network in a desperate search for help.<br />\nIn her quest, Arid (Armoured Robotics Interface Device) invades the bodies of three strange robots and attempts to enlist their aid. Arid may be unbound, but she&#39;s going to find that not everyone is as flexible as she is... or thinks she is. A truly bizarre story awaits you in The Fall Part 2: Unbound.</p>"
