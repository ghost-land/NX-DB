    "description": "<p>Nushi Tsuri 64 (\u306c\u3057\u91e3\u308a\uff16\uff14, lit. Fishing Master) is a fishing video game for the Nintendo 64. It was released only in Japan in 1998. It was followed by a sequel Nushi Tsuri 64: Shiokaze Ninotte in 2000.<br />\nThere are six characters from which players can choose from before they start the game. Like in most role-playing games, the town can be freely explored in addition to other towns. The stuff that be purchased is mostly fishing-related. Random encounters can occur while walking; players can choose to throw rocks to chase them away or run across a path in order to reach safety.</p>"
