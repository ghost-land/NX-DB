    "description": "<p>Spartan X 2 is a 1991 beat &#39;em up video game developed by Tamtex and published by Irem exclusively in Japan for the Family Computer. It is a sequel to Irem&#39;s 1984 coin-operated video game Spartan X (released internationally by Data East under the title of Kung-Fu Master), which was later ported to the Family Computer by Nintendo in 1985. In turn, Spartan X was originally a tie-in to the 1984 Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals (released as Spartan X in Japan). Spartan X 2 did not receive a North American release until 2016, when it was included as a built-in title for the Retro-Bit Generations retro video game console under the name Kung-Fu Master 2.</p>"
