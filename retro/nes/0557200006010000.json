    "description": "<p>In this action-packed sequel to the popular Contra, players have little<br />\ntime to think. Experience run-and-gun gameplay at its best as you take<br />\ncontrol of Mad Dog or Scorpion and once again battle the forces of Red<br />\nFalcon. Stages feature a combination of perspectives (side scrolling,<br />\ntop down, etc.) and intense battles against huge bosses. Use a variety<br />\nof powerful weapons and tap into your killer instinct to survive the<br />\ndeadly waves of enemies. Because if your trigger finger lacks stamina,<br />\nthen Earth will lack a future!<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. We hope you&#39;ll enjoy the new features (including off-TV play) that have been added to this title. See more Virtual Console games for Wii U.</p>"
