    "description": "<p>Legacy of the Wizard, originally released in Japan as Dragon Slayer IV: Drasle Family (\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30b9\u30ec\u30a4\u30e4\u30fcIV \u30c9\u30e9\u30b9\u30ec\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30ea\u30fc) is a fantasy-themed action role-playing platform game released for the MSX, MSX2 and Famicom in Japan and for the Nintendo Entertainment System in the United States. Legacy of the Wizard is an installment in Falcom's Dragon Slayer series, and one of only five Dragon Slayer games that were localized outside Japan (before the Trails series was picked up by XSEED). The game was an early example of an open-world, non-linear action RPG, combining action-RPG gameplay with what would later be called \"Metroidvania\"-style action-adventure elements.</p>"
