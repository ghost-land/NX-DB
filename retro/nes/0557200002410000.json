Unlike most games in the series, this game is actually a role-playing game, a genre which was used first in the Ganbare Goemon Gaiden games for the Famicom. The game also borrows some concepts from the franchise's anime series.</p>\n<p>The protagonist in the game is a boy named Hiroshi, who somehow gets transported into a Ganbare Goemon game and teams with Goemon in order to save Japan from some evil force.</p>"
