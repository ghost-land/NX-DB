    "description": "<p>This hack is the combination of three individual hacks. It was created to be the ultimate NES remake of a classic game.</p>\n<p>The original palette has been utilized and the layout of the map is exactly as the original. The only exception is the room where you fight Ridley. To reduce flicker (as much as possible) I had to place Ridley above the doors.</p>\n<p>I do not claim any credit for the actual content - only for the hard work of making it all work together.</p>\n<p>All credits go to the below listed hacks and their individual authors:</p>\n<p>Metroid + Saving (v 0.3) - snarfblam: http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1186/</p>\n<pre><code>Minimap  \nSavefiles  \nBeamstacking  \nBetter icebeam and bombs\n</code></pre>\n<p>MDbtroid - Infinity\u2019s End: http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1219/</p>\n<pre><code>Nicer title screen  \nNicer endings  \nUpdated run animation  \nUpdated player sprite (suited and suitless)  \nUpdated enemy sprites  \nEnlarged and updated Kraid and Ridley  \nUpdated Mother Brain  \nVarious updated tiles\n</code></pre>\n<p>\u2018Roidz - DemickXII: http://www.romhacking.net/hacks/1240/</p>\n<pre><code>Nicer background tiles  \nAnimated lava, doors and elevators  \nAnimated corridors  \nAnimated Norfair (Ridley level)  \nAnimated Tourian (Mother Brain level)  \nVarious updated tiles\n</code></pre>"
