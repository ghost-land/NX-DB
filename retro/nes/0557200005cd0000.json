    "description": "<p>Spot: The Video Game is a video game developed and produced by Virgin Mastertronic in 1990/1991 for the Amiga, Atari ST, MS-DOS computers, Game Boy and NES. It is the first video game to feature the then current 7 Up mascot \"Spot\", and was later followed up by platformers Cool Spot and Spot Goes To Hollywood. Its gameplay is similar to the video game \"Ataxx\".</p>\n<p>Initially the Amiga and Atari ST versions of the game were known as Infection, and were due to be released as budget titles. When the license was added the price increased; however, the non-branded Infection version of the game was released by developer Gary Dunne as freeware in 1994.</p>\n<p>Graeme Devine recalled that the NES version was created \"over six weeks with no development hardware or software\".</p>\n<p>For a limited time, a mail-in promotion was offered to purchase the NES version for $24.99, along with four labels from specially marked 7up bottles.</p>"
