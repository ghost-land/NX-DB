    "description": "<p>WWF WrestleMania (named after the annual pay-per-view event) is an Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) video game created by Rare and published by Acclaim Entertainment in 1989. It was the first WWF licensed NES game and the second WWF game overall, the first being MicroLeague Wrestling. WrestleMania also marked the beginning of a long relationship between Acclaim and the WWF which lasted ten years. Released just months prior to WrestleMania V, it was intended to help build up to that event. The game&#39;s title screen features the tagline for WrestleMania III: &quot;Bigger. Better. Badder.&quot;<br />\nRare later developed a follow-up game, WWF WrestleMania Challenge.</p>"
