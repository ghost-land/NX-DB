    "description": "<p>Kirby&#39;s Adventure is a 1993 action-platform video game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Entertainment System. It is the second game in the Kirby series after his debut on the Game Boy and the first to include the Copy ability, which allows Kirby to gain power-ups from eating certain enemies. It is the only NES game in the Kirby series, released towards the end of the NES&#39;s lifespan and pushed the palette and graphical capabilities of the NES to its limit.<br />\nThe game centers around Kirby traveling across Dream Land to repair the Star Rod after King Dedede breaks it apart and gives the pieces to his minions. The Star Rod serves as the power source of the Fountain of Dreams and insures that all residents of Dream Land will have restful sleep.<br />\nA remake of the game for the Game Boy Advance, titled Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land, was released in 2002 featuring enhanced graphics and multiplayer support. The NES version of Kirby&#39;s Adventure was re-released on the Wii via the Virtual Console in February 2007. A 3D Classics version was released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop in November 2011 and a Virtual Console version for the Wii U was released in April 2013.<br />\nThe game was critically acclaimed and is considered one of the best NES games of all time.</p>"
