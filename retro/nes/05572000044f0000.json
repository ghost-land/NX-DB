    "description": "<p>Nekketsu Kakut\u014d Densetsu (Roughly translated, &quot;Hot-Blooded Fighting Legend&quot; or sometimes, &quot;Legend of the Burning Fighters&quot;) is a tournament-style fighting game for the Famicom, both developed and published by Techn\u014ds Japan released on December 23, 1992. It has sometimes been referred to as Riki Kunio in English; as in one unofficial translation, but since the title is vague and could refer to any number of Kunio games, most Western fans call it by its original Japanese name.</p>\n<p>Story<br />\nOne day at school, Kunio was minding his own business when suddenly, he found a note on his locker. The note says their is a fighting tournament hosted by the Saber Tiger association. Seeing it as a challenge he could not refuse, Kunio runs off to participate. When Riki sees Kunio running and reads his note, he decides to enter as well. Many other fighters will join in to see who is the strongest.</p>\n<p>Gameplay<br />\nThe game is a tournament fighter that focuses on 4 players in an arena. Depending on the selected mode in the game, players fight in either free-for-all or 2-on-2 battles. While all combatants can kick and punch their opponents, each of them have their own abilities, moves, and stats. Some arenas in the game have hazards that players need to pay attention to or risk losing additional health. Whenever a player is knocked out of a match, they will leave behind an item that other surviving players can pick up that can help or hinder them.The last person (or people in 2 vs. 2 fights) standing wins the match alone or for the team.</p>"
