    "description": "<p>Metroid: Rogue Dawn is an unofficial prequel to the original Metroid game released in 1986. 30 years later, we bring you the events that unfolded before Samus\u2019s famous \u201czero\u201d mission on planet Zebes.</p>\n<p>The original Metroid manual tells us about a deep-space research ship that was attacked. The Space Pirates seized a capsule said to contain a previously unknown life form in a state of suspended animation. Rogue Dawn surrounds these events that led up to the theft of the capsule, which ultimately placed the Metroids under the control of Ridley and the Mother Brain. The mission to acquire the capsule was placed in the hands of one of Ridley\u2019s best-kept secrets: a rogue human agent, trained and manipulated by Ridley from a young age\u2026</p>"
