    "description": "<p>Saint Seiya: Ougon Densetsu Kanketsu Hen (Saint Seiya : Knights of the Zodiac) is a Action RPG video game published by Bandai released on 1988 for the NES.<br />\nThis game is based upon the Twelve Gold Cloth saga in the Saint Seiya animated TV series that was produced in the 1980\u2019s. Currently the show is being broadcast in the USA, but very badly censored and edited. Green blood? Please. I saw this show when I was nine years old, nudity and blood and all, every saturday morning, and our parents didn\u2019t complain! Much. Ahem.</p>"
