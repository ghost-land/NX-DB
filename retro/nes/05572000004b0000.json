As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent asks two<br />\nstreet-smart brawlers, the &quot;Bad Dudes&quot; named Blade and Striker:<br />\n&quot;President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough<br />\ndude to rescue Ronnie?&quot; After hearing that, the Bad Dudes pursue the<br />\nninjas through the New York City streets, a moving big rig truck, a<br />\nlarge storm sewer, a forest, a freight train on an old Southern Pacific<br />\nline, a cave and into an underground factory in order to save President<br />\nRonnie.</p>"
