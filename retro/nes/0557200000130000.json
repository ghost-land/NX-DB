    "description": "<p>Adventures in the Magic Kingdom is a video game released on June 1, 1990 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Its soundtrack was composed by Yoko Shimomura. The game was released in five different regions (British Isles, North America, France, Scandinavia, and Australasia), using three different retail covers. The game places the player as a nameless main character, of whom the player can enter a name at the start of the game. Goofy left the golden key for the castle gate inside, and Mickey Mouse asks for the player's help to find six silver keys needed to open the Cinderella Castle gate and allow the Disney parade to begin. After completing this task, Mickey congratulates the player and the parade begins.</p>"
