    "description": "<p>Stack-Up (also known as Robot Block and simply Block (\u30d6\u30ed\u30c3\u30af, Burokku) in Japan) is a video game released in 1985 for the Nintendo Entertainment System, designed for use with R.O.B. the Robotic Operating Buddy. Stack-Up is one of two games in Nintendo's Robot Series, the other being Gyromite (Robot Gyro in Japan). While Gyromite is a pack-in game with the R.O.B. itself and therefore comes with all the parts needed to play the game, Stack-Up comes in a large box containing additional bases and colored discs. The game's retail box comes with many, many small, plastic parts, which may contribute to difficulty in maintaining a complete set. Stack-Up is considered by those who are in the know to be one of the rarest first-party games for the NES.</p>\n<p>Because 1985's newly released NES game console is internally compatible with 1983's Famicom game console, all Stack-Up GamePak cartridges contain the 60-pin circuit board of a Famicom cartridge, attached to a 72-pin adapter like the T89 Cartridge Converter for the NES. This GamePak may be disassembled to reclaim its Famicom-to-NES adapter, for use in modifying other Famicom cartridges to work on NES.</p>"
