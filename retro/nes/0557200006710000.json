    "description": "<p>Tecmo World Cup Soccer is a video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Released in 1990 by Tecmo, as its name suggests it is a soccer game focusing on the World Cup.</p>\n<p>Tecmo World Cup Soccer is not to be confused with Nintendo World Cup of the same year, nor Tecmo Cup Soccer Game released in September 1992, is a port of Tehkan World Cup adapted to the NES hardware. Although the two games appear virtually identical, Tecmo World Cup Soccer lacks some of the speed and fluidity of its arcade progenitor. While the gameplay is ostensibly unchanged, the lack of support for analog control in the NES version renders it a digital-control-only game that requires almost completely different tactics.</p>"
