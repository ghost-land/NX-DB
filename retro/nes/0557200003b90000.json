The story involves the player character, who suffers from amnesia, traveling through time in an attempt to rescue Princess Scheherazade from the evil wizard Sabaron, who has summoned the demon Goragora to do his bidding.<br />\nThe game was innovative for its time, incorporating elements of action-adventure and RPG styles, featuring a unique setting based on the Arabian Nights, allowing time travel between five different time periods, having two different combat systems for real-time solo action and turn-based team battles, and introducing team attacks where two party members could join forces to perform an extra-powerful attack. A manga based on the game was released in Japan.</p>"
