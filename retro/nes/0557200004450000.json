    "description": "<p>Narc is a 1988 arcade game designed by Eugene Jarvis for Williams Electronics and programmed by George Petro. It was one of the first ultra-violent video games and a frequent target of parental criticism of the arcade game industry. The object is to arrest and kill drug offenders, confiscate their money and drugs, and defeat \"Mr. Big\". It was the first game in the newly restarted Williams Electronics coin-op division, after being acquired by Midway.</p>\n<p>Narc was ported to the Commodore 64, Atari ST, Amiga, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC home computers by Ocean Software in 1990. Narc was ported to the NES in 1990 by Rare. In 2005, the franchise was re-launched with a brand new game for the Xbox and PS2.</p>\n<p>Max Force and Mr. Big appeared as characters in the cartoon The Power Team.</p>"
