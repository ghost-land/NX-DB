    "description": "<p>Renegade is a video game released in 1986 by Taito. It is a westernized conversion (including changes to all of the sprites and backgrounds) of the Japanese arcade game Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun (\u71b1\u8840\u786c\u6d3e\u304f\u306b\u304a\u304f\u3093, which roughly translates to &quot;Hot-Blooded Tough Guy Kunio&quot;), released earlier the same year by Technos. It is an immediate technological predecessor to Double Dragon, and Nekketsu K\u014dha Kunio-kun is the inaugural game in the Kunio-kun series (which includes Super Dodge Ball and River City Ransom).<br />\nRenegade first introduced several trademarks of the beat &#39;em up genre, including 4-directional control, punch-jump-kick play action, and enemies which can sustain multiple hits. It is considered to be one of the most influential titles of the video game industry.</p>"
