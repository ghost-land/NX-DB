    "description": "<p>Metal Gear is an overhead military action-adventure stealth video game originally released in 1987 by Konami for the MSX2 computer in Japan and parts of Europe. Considered to be the progenitor of the stealth game genre, it is the first video game designed by Hideo Kojima, who directed many of the later Metal Gear sequels. A reworked version was released for the Famicom a few months later, which saw a release in North America for the NES the following year, although this version featured drastically altered level designs among other changes, and was developed without Kojima&#39;s involvement. A more faithful port of the MSX2 version was later included in Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence for the PlayStation 2, as well as in the HD Edition of the same game released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Vita, with these newer ports featuring a revised translation and additional gameplay features.<br />\nThe game revolves around a special forces operative codenamed Solid Snake who goes into a solo infiltration mission into the fortified state of Outer Heaven to destroy Metal Gear, a bipedal walking tank capable of launching nuclear missiles from anywhere in the world.</p>"
