    "description": "<p>R.C. Pro-Am II is a racing video game developed by Rare and released by Tradewest for the Nintendo Entertainment System on December 11, 1992. The game is the sequel to the 1988 R.C. Pro-Am and features similar gameplay with a wider variety of tracks, currency-based vehicle and weapon upgrades, and bonus stages. In R.C. Pro-Am\u00a0II, four players, either human or artificial intelligence, race on a series of tracks to finish first while avoiding obstacles and hazards. The winner receives race points and money. The game features a multiplayer mode in which up to four human players can compete against each other simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Reviewers praised the sequel's additional features and variety, while others found its gameplay unoriginal compared to the original and its contemporaries. Critics lauded the multiplayer mode, which some said was a reason alone to buy the game. The game was released in Rare's 2015 Rare Replay compilation for Xbox One.</p>"
