    "description": "<p>Al Unser Jr.'s Turbo Racing is a racing video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System console released in 1990. It is an adaption of the 1989 Japanese-market Famicom game World Grand Prix - Pole to Finish (\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\u30b0\u30e9\u30f3\u30d7\u30ea \u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30c8\u30a5\u30d5\u30a3\u30cb\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5), with the most notable changes being the addition of Unser as an in-game coach, the number of laps, sound and interface design. This game features a season mode and two time trial modes. In season mode the player uses either Al Unser Jr. or make their own driver.</p>\n<p>Versions released outside North America were simply titled Turbo Racing with all references to Unser removed, due to the relative obscurity of CART and Unser outside of North America.</p>"
