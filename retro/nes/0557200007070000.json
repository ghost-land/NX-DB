It is a business simulation game that is similar to board game Monopoly, in which players and the computer AI take turns going around a set of connected squares, buying up property, and charging other participants rent when they land on those spaces.</p>\n<p>Wily &amp; Right no RockBoard was released on January 15, 1993 for the Family Computer only in Japan, though an unreleased English translation and a Game Boy version may have been in development. Critical reception for the game from Western gaming websites has been decidedly poor.</p>"
