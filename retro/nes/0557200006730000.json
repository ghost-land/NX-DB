    "description": "<p>Tecmo World Wrestling is a Nintendo Entertainment System professional wrestling game for one or two players released in 1989 where the player can control one of ten fictional international professional wrestlers. This is the first wrestling game to feature a play-by-play announcer, the animated Tom Talker, although his speech was only text bubbles. The game's text, e.g. Tom Talker's commentary, was translated from the Japanese game almost directly, leading to instances of Engrish. For example the Northern Lights Suplex is called \"Northern Right Suplex\". The game was released in Japan under the name Gekitou Pro Wrestling!! Toukon Densetsu (\u6fc0\u95d8\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9!! \u95d8\u9b42\u4f1d\u8aac, Gekitou Puroresu!! Toukon Densetsu)</p>"
