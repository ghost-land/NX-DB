    "description": "<p>Kid Niki: Radical Ninja, known in Japan as Kaiketsu Yanchamaru (\u5feb\u5091\u30e4\u30f3\u30c1\u30e3\u4e38, lit. &quot;The Wonderful Yanchamaru&quot;), is an arcade game developed and published by Irem in 1986, and was later published outside Japan by Data East in 1987. The arcade game runs on Irem-62 Hardware, the same as Kung Fu Master.<br />\nThe differences between the Kid Niki: Radical Ninja and Kaiketsu Yancha Maru are minimal. Aside from text translation, the most glaring difference is the main character&#39;s hair style. Kid Niki&#39;s hair is more &quot;punk rock&quot; with wild spikes and a ponytail in the back. Yancha Maru&#39;s hair has more subdued spikes and a topknot (or chonmage). In the arcade version of the game, the main character&#39;s keikogi is yellow while it is red in the home ports.</p>"
