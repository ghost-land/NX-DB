    "description": "<p>Skate or Die 2: The Search for Double Trouble is a skateboarding themed action/adventure game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, developed and published by Electronic Arts, who also developed the first game, which was ported by Konami's Ultra Games subsidiary. It is well known for successfully using digitized vocals and electric guitar in the opening theme (composed, along with the rest of the game's music, by Rob Hubbard), rarely seen on the NES. A 2012 three-part video interview on black metal revealed that the skater on the box art was young Jef Whitehead, the sole member of Leviathan.</p>"
