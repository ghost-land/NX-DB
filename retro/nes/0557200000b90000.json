    "description": "<p>Bucky O'Hare (\u30d0\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc \u30aa\u30d8\u30a2, Bakk\u012b Ohea) is a 1992 action platformer video game for the Nintendo Entertainment System based on the comic book series of the same name. The game was developed and published by Konami, and was released in North America in January 1992, in Japan on January 31, 1992 and in Europe on February 18, 1993.</p>\n<p>The game required Bucky to rescue each of his crew members (except Bruiser, who is not featured in the game) on a series of planets. As each character was rescued, the player gained the ability to switch between them and Bucky on the fly to deal with different problems. Immediately after regaining his entire crew, they are once again captured and imprisoned on the Toad mother ship. Bucky and Blinky, sharing the same cell, break out and must rescue the remaining members. Afterwards, you continue through the ship.</p>\n<p>An arcade game by Konami was also released which allowed players to control Bucky, Jenny, Willy, Deadeye, or Blinky in a format similar to the arcade games based on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or The Simpsons. This also featured the original voice cast from the TV series.</p>"
