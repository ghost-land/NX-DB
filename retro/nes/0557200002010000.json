    "description": "<p>Final Fantasy is a fantasy role-playing video game developed and published by Square in 1987. It is the first game in Square&#39;s Final Fantasy series, created by Hironobu Sakaguchi. Originally released for the NES, Final Fantasy was remade for several video game consoles and is frequently packaged with Final Fantasy II in video game collections. The story follows four youths called the Light Warriors, who each carry one of their world&#39;s four elemental orbs which have been darkened by the four Elemental Fiends. Together, they quest to defeat these evil forces, restore light to the orbs, and save their world.<br />\nFinal Fantasy was originally conceived under the working title Fighting Fantasy, but trademark issues and dire circumstances surrounding Square as well as Sakaguchi himself prompted the name to be changed. The game was a great commercial success, received generally positive reviews, and spawned many successful sequels and supplementary titles in the form of the Final Fantasy series. The original is now regarded as one of the most influential and successful role-playing games on the Nintendo Entertainment System, playing a major role in popularizing the genre. Critical praise focused on the game&#39;s graphics, while criticism targeted the time spent wandering in search of random battle encounters to raise the player&#39;s experience level. By March 2003, all versions of the original Final Fantasy had sold a combined total of two million copies worldwide.</p>"
