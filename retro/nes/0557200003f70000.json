    "description": "<p>The first installment of the immensely successful Metroid series<br />\nintroduces us to the hideous title creatures and the slick, cybernetic<br />\nbounty hunter Samus Aran. As Samus\u2122, your mission is to penetrate the<br />\nspace pirates&#39; home planet, Zebes, and keep them from destroying the<br />\ngalaxy with the dangerous life forms known as Metroids. Metroid has all<br />\nthe high-tech weaponry, creepy tunnels and crawly alien creatures that<br />\nanyone could ask for. With its deep and complex game play, excellent<br />\nmusic and a rare sense of setting, it establishes a frightening ambience<br />\nthat will haunt and entertain you for a very long time.<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. We hope you&#39;ll enjoy the new features (including off-TV play) that have been added to this title. See more Virtual Console games for Wii U.</p>"
