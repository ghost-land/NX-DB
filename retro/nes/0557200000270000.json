He&#39;s Kid Dracula, star of the mythical Transylvania 92010, and the coolest living corpse ever to stake his claim on the Game Boy. If you thought Mario had a way with magic, you should see junior jugular&#39;s spellbinding powers, including the mesmerizing bat transformation. Poof! Nobody wings it better than Kid Drac.</p>"
