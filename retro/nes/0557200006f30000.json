    "description": "<p>Konami Wai Wai World (\u30b3\u30ca\u30df\u30ef\u30a4\u30ef\u30a4\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9), &quot;wai wai&quot; being a Japanese onomatopoeia for a noisy, crowded area, is a 1988 Family Computer platform video game released only in Japan by Konami. The game itself stars various Konami created characters as well as Mikey (from The Goonies) and King Kong, who appeared in two Konami-produced, movie-based games.</p>\n<p>The player starts the game as Konami Man and can switch between Konami Man and Konami Lady. If two players are gaming, then one will play as Konami Man and the other as Konami Lady. Both players are not able to switch characters until they rescue at least one character from one of the six levels. The player must play through six different selectable levels that take place in different Konami games. Subsequently the player uses a key to save that game&#39;s star character, who then becomes playable. Each character has different abilities to begin with as well as ones they can eventually gain. The player ventures through these first six levels in a sort of nonlinear fashion with gameplay very similar to the original Castlevania games. After these stages are completed, the player plays through a scrolling space shooter stage and then a linear final stage.</p>\n<p>The player can also regularly visit the lab of Dr. Cinnamon (from the TwinBee series), who gives the player the game&#39;s character profiles and refills energy when needed. Through his lab, the player can also talk to Saimon, Dr. Cinnamon&#39;s brother, who can resurrect any defeated characters at the cost of 100 bullets per character during the game.</p>"
