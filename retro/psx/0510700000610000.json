    "description": "<p>Blazing Dragons is a point-and-click adventure video game developed by the Illusions Gaming Company and published by Crystal Dynamics for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn consoles. It is based on the television series of the same name. In a twist on the legend of King Arthur, the player controls Flicker, a dragon who lives in Camelhot castle and is in love with Princess Flame, but is not eligible to ask for her hand in marriage because he is not a knight. However, the King has announced a dragon tournament, where the winner will not only win the princess, but also become the new king.</p>\n<p>The humour in the game is heavily influenced by Monty Python. The voice cast is headed by Terry Jones, Cheech Marin and Harry Shearer, along with supporting performances from veteran voice actors such as Jim Cummings, Jeff Bennett, Kath Soucie, Jess Harnell, Gregg Berger, and Charlie Adler.</p>"
