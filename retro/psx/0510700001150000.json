    "description": "8ball is a pick-up-and-play take on the well-known and loved game of eight-ball pool (known to some as 'stripes and solids'). There are 15 balls on the table - 7 solid coloured, 7 striped and the black eight-ball. Sink your half of the balls and then the eight-ball before your opponent to win!<br/><br/>8ball includes a global, cross platform high-score list that allows you to share your top scores and compete for the highest score possible against other players from all over the world - regardless of which device or platform they play the game on."
