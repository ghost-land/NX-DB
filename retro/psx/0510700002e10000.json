    "description": "<p>The ultimate fight to the finish line! Road Rash returns in spectacular 3D! A full-contact, teeth-clenching blast on treacherous canyon ridges, high-speed freeways, and crowded city streets where twisted bikers tear through a gauntlet of combat racing. All-new 3D world with 100 miles of interconnected roads. Motion-captured riders and responsive physics model for a true motorcycle feel. Four distinct gangs and 12 customized bikes. Close-combat attacks &amp; weapons including chains &amp; clubs. Original thrashin&#39; soundtrack with tunes from CIV, Full on the Mouth, Kid Rock, The Mermen, Sugar Ray, and The Tea Party!</p>"
