    "description": "<p>Star Wars: Rebel Assault II: The Hidden Empire is a 1995 video game developed by LucasArts. It is the sequel to Star Wars: Rebel Assault, set in the Star Wars expanded universe.<br />\nThe player character, Rookie One, commands ships like a YT-1300 Corellian Transport, a B-wing, and a Y-wing, and encounters new opponents, like TIE Interceptors. The fly videos seem to move and rotate according to controller inputs, creating the illusion of steering the ship (which in reality is following a &#39;rail&#39; in a pre-rendered course).<br />\nIt contains mostly original filming with actors and stunts, while the scenery and the space scenes were 3D rendered. According to LucasArts&#39; magazine &quot;The Adventurer&quot;, the game was the first media to incorporate live-action actors and footage in the Star Wars universe since Return of the Jedi. The game makes use of the INSANE game engine.</p>"
