    "description": "<p>NASCAR Rumble is a racing video game created by Electronic Arts for the PlayStation. Players race through 18 different courses set in six different areas collecting powerups to aid them. The game was met with fairly positive reviews, and earned an 80% on GameRankings. The game is a departure from many NASCAR games, as it is an arcade racing featuring various tracks and Mario Kart-esque powerups. A non-NASCAR licensed sequel was made for the PlayStation 2, called Rumble Racing.</p>"
