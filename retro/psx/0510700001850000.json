    "description": "<p>I.Q.: Intelligent Qube (Intelligent Qube in North America and Kurushi in Europe) is a puzzle game for the PlayStation. In the game, the player controls a character who must run around a platform made of cubes, clearing certain cubes as they approach. Cubes are &quot;cleared&quot; by marking a spot on the stage, waiting for the cube to roll on top of it, and then deactivating the marked spot.<br />\nThe game was well received by critics. The game performed well commercially in Japan and even won the Excellence Award for Interactive Art at the 1997 Japan Media Arts Festival. A few sequels have been developed and the game has since been re-released on PlayStation Network in Japan and Europe.</p>"
