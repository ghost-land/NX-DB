    "description": "<p>With shopkeepers, pedestrians, and The Man hassling you, what&#39;s a skater to do? You need to find a place to put in the bruising, bone-braking hours needed to hone your skills. With Street Sk8er 2, you simply turn an abandoned warehouse into your own personal skate park. Use the natural obstacles such as pipes and rails as departure points for your tricks and combos (over 200 to put in your repertoire). Once you&#39;ve got the space as you like it, slap it on a separately sold memory card, truck it over to your friend&#39;s PlayStation, and see how your friend does.</p>\n<p>Once you&#39;ve got the moves down, take them to the crowd in the three-level Street Tour World Championship. Race against the clock while collecting special trick points in 11 events that include street, halfpipe, and park courses. Don&#39;t worry if you have trouble hanging with the big boys--Street Sk8er 2 has a variety of skill levels and a free-skate mode that lets you indolently explore the game&#39;s many courses.</p>"
