    "description": "<p>Brigandine is a tactical role-playing game for the PlayStation video game console, created by developer Hearty Robin and released in 1998. An American port, called Brigandine: The Legend of Forsena, was released in the same year by Atlus. In 2000, Hearty Robin released a remake of the game called Brigandine: Grand Edition, which included multiplayer support, along other new features. In the game, the player chooses one of the nations of the fictional continent of Forsena, and has the goal of conquering the other nations by taking their castles, using troops composed by human commanders and fictional creatures. Although primarily a turn-based strategy game, the game includes some characteristics of tactical role-playing games.</p>"
