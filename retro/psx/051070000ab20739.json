    "description": "<p>Tomba!, known as Tombi! in Europe and Ore! Tomba (\u30aa\u30ec\u3063!\u30c8\u30f3\u30d0, Ore! Tonba, lit. &quot;Me! Tomba&quot;) in Japan, is a side-scrolling platform game developed by Whoopee Camp for the PlayStation console. Tomba! was first released in Japan in December 1997, and in North America and Europe in 1998. The game was followed by a sequel, Tomba! 2: The Evil Swine Return. The colorful imaginative atmosphere and innovative gameplay has continued to keep it nostalgically popular with gamers. The series is the brainchild of Tokuro Fujiwara. It was also one of the first PlayStation games to take advantage of the DualShock feature. The game was re-released on the PlayStation Network in 2011.</p>"
