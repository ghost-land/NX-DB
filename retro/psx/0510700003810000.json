    "description": "<p>WCW Backstage Assault is a professional wrestling video game by Electronic Arts. It was the final World Championship Wrestling (WCW) game released as the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) purchased the company&#39;s assets three months later. Backstage Assault features commentary by Tony Schiavone and Bobby &quot;The Brain&quot; Heenan. The game is distinguished by the fact that all gameplay takes place outside of a standard wrestling ring. This approach was very poorly received and the game sold only 200,000 copies. A PlayStation 2 port was under development, but cancelled.</p>"
