It was developed and released by Bandai in Japan, parts of Europe, and North America in 1997. The game was reissued in Europe in 2002 and in North America in 2004. The game shares the distinction of being the first Dragon Ball game to be rendered in full 3D, and the last Dragon Ball game produced for the PlayStation.
