    "description": "<p>It&#39;s time to get mythical and kick some Greek monster butt. Try on the super-strength of Hercules, or the fighting speed of Atlanta, or the street smarts of Jason. It&#39;s open season on the one-eyed Cyclops, the multi-headed Hydra, Medusa with the snake hairdo, sword-swinging skeletons, deranged gods, nasty Martians, crazy clowns and other not-so-mythological monstrosities. With your arsenal of arrows, slingshots, swords, houses, sheep, inflarable cows and ray guns it&#39;s up to you to save ancient civilization from massive myth-fortune.</p>"
