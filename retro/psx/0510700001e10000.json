    "description": "<p>MediEvil 2, stylised as MediEvil II in North America, is an action-adventure hack and slash video game developed by SCE Cambridge Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation. It is the second instalment of the MediEvil series and a sequel to MediEvil. It was first released on 19 April 2000 in Europe and 30 April 2000 in North America. Taking place 500 years after the events of the first game, it follows series&#39; protagonist Sir Daniel Fortesque&#39;s revival in Victorian era London as he attempts to stop sorcerer Lord Palethorn and Jack the Ripper&#39;s plans to terrorise the city by raising the dead.<br />\nFollowing the positive reception of the first game, Sony Computer Entertainment commissioned SCE Cambridge Studio to make a sequel to MediEvil before the end of the PlayStation&#39;s lifespan. The original concepts for MediEvil 2 went through many transformations during development before the Cambridge team finally settled on making a sequel set during the Victorian Gothic revival, largely reminiscent of its predecessor. The game received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release, with praise including slight improvements over its predecessor, such as artificial intelligence and graphical enhancements, but was criticised for lack of innovation from the original.</p>"
