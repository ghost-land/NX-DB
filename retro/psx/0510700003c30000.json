The game&#39;s protagonist, T&#39;ai Fu, is the last remaining survivor of the Tiger clan and must journey to defeat the Dragon Master and avenge his kind. On the way, he learns about his clouded past and masters several Kung Fu styles, one from each clan master he defeats. The game became one of the influences for the DreamWorks Animation film series, Kung Fu Panda which Jeffrey Katzenberg worked on both of them.</p>"
