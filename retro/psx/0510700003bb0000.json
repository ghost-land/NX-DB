It is a spinoff from Konami's earlier International Superstar Soccer series.</p>\n<p>Every year, the game is released around late September and/or early October with two different titles: World Soccer: Winning Eleven in Japan and Asia (excluding Indonesia and Malaysia), and Pro Evolution Soccer in Europe, North America and Indonesia. The Japanese version is a localized version that features local leagues. Partially as a result of EA Sports' affinity to purchasing exclusive rights for their FIFA series, the games have historically lacked the sheer volume of licenses present in EA's offerings, with the most notable absences being the Premier League and Bundesliga. As such, team jerseys, names and players may be inaccurate.</p>\n<p>Cristiano Ronaldo was the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover in 2008, 2012 and 2013. He has since been replaced by Mario G\u00f6tze for 2015, who was replaced by Neymar and \u00c1lvaro Morata for 2016.</p>\n<p>As of December 2011, the Pro Evolution Soccer franchise has been localized into 19 languages and available in 62 countries. As of December 2012, the series have been sold more than 81.65 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises.</p>"
