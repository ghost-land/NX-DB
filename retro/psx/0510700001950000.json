    "description": "<p>Jet Moto 2 (known as Jet Rider 2 in Europe and Jet Moto &#39;98 in Japan) is a 1997 racing video game developed by SingleTrac and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation video game console. It is the sequel to the 1996 game Jet Moto. It was released in North America on October 31, 1997, in Europe in April 1998, and in Japan on August 6, 1998. In January 2008 Jet Moto 2 was made available for the PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network. The PlayStation Greatest Hits version, branded within the game as Jet Moto 2: Championship Edition, is slightly different from the original in that the framerate is increased, the number of competitors is limited to four, and all the original Jet Moto tracks were unlocked from the start.<br />\nAs with Jet Moto, gameplay in Jet Moto 2 revolves around the use of hoverbikes to traverse a race course, similar to modern day motorcross, but with the added ability to traverse water. Reviews for Jet Moto 2 were mixed. It currently holds a 70.08% at GameRankings, a video game aggregator. Reviewers felt the game was an improvement over the original, but again criticized its high difficulty. Jet Moto 2&#39;s popularity would spawn one additional sequel, Jet Moto 3.</p>"
