    "description": "<p>Evil Zone is a fighting game released for the PlayStation console. It was developed by Yuke&#39;s Future Media Creators and published by Titus Software in 1999. The player can choose from ten characters to fight in several game modes including story mode, arcade mode, versus mode, practice and survival mode.<br />\nThe storyline of the game tells of a being known as Ihadurca, a powerful being who can exist in multiple dimensions at one time. Through heavy cost, the inhabitants of the world of I-Praseru (Happy Island) were able to temporarily confine Ihadurca in a dimension known as Evil Zone. Now, a tournament is being held to select the strongest warrior throughout the dimensions to destroy Ihadurca before she can escape from Evil Zone and threaten the world once more.<br />\nThe story mode is a unique aspect of the game and sets it apart from other fighting games. Each character has a unique story mode which progresses like an ongoing television program, complete with episode names and previews with voice acting. As the mode progresses, you learn more about the character&#39;s backstory and why they are fighting, an incentive to play the game with each character. Evil Zone is also one of the few games to feature a fully fleshed out story mode for its boss character.</p>"
