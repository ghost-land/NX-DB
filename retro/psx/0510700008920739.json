    "description": "<p>Skullmonkeys is a platform video game developed by DreamWorks Interactive and published by Electronic Arts exclusively for PlayStation. It is the sequel to The Neverhood, and rather than being a graphic adventure, it is a platformer. The setting of it came from a place described in The Neverhood Hall of Records in the Neverhood by one of the other god-like beings (like Hoborg) created by Quater.<br />\nTerry Scott Taylor, the composer of the first game, again did the soundtrack. A PlayStation Magazine reviewer called the music of the game as the best game music he had ever heard.</p>"
