The game was developed by Square Co., creators of the Final Fantasy series of video games. The game was first released in Japan in March 1999. North American and European releases followed that year.<br />\nAs a formulaic kart racer, Chocobo Racing is often compared to Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing. The game&#39;s star and namesake is the Chocobo, the mascot of the Final Fantasy series. Other figures from the game series, such as Mog the Moogle, the Black Mage, and Cid, fill out the all-Final Fantasy cast. Most of the game&#39;s soundtrack is composed using tunes from previous Final Fantasy titles.<br />\nThe game was later released in Japan alongside Chocobo Stallion and Dice de Chocobo as part of the Chocobo Collection. On December 20, 2001, the game was re-released individually as part of the PSone Books series. The game received generally average reviews, citing its low quality in several aspects of gameplay.<br />\nIt was released in Japan as a PSOne Classic on February 10, 2009.</p>"
