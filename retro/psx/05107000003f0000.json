    "description": "<p>Batman: Return of the Joker, known in Japan as Dynamite Batman (\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30de\u30a4\u30c8\u30d0\u30c3\u30c8\u30de\u30f3, Dainamaito Battoman), is a 1991 platform video game, the follow-up to Sunsoft's first Batman game on the Nintendo Entertainment System. Unlike that game, which was based on the 1989 Batman film directed by Tim Burton, Return of the Joker is entirely self-contained and based more on the modern comic book iteration of Batman. However, Batman mans the Batmobile from the 1989 film. A remake of Return of the Joker, titled Batman: Revenge of the Joker, was released on the Sega Genesis by Ringler Studios in 1992. A Super NES version of Revenge of the Joker was in development, but never released.</p>\n<p>A completely different version of the game was released on the Game Boy in 1992.</p>"
