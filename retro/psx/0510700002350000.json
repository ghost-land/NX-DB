    "description": "<p>NBA Jam Extreme is a 1996 basketball arcade game by Acclaim Entertainment based on the 1996\u201397 NBA season. After Midway Games released two NBA Jam games, Acclaim, the publisher of the home versions of NBA Jam, ended up winning the exclusive rights to use the Jam name. NBA Jam Extreme was the first Jam game from Acclaim, as well as the first edition of the game to use 3D graphics. In contrast, Midway's competing NBA game NBA Hangtime featured 2-D visuals similar to the previous Jam games. Extreme also features longtime sports broadcaster Marv Albert doing commentary instead of original commentator Tim Kitzrow. New to the game is the \"Extreme\" button, essentially a super version of the series' trademark \"Turbo\" button.</p>\n<p>The game was used as the basis for a PlayStation demo game (which has gone rare) based on the NBA's 2Ball competition, which included 1997-98 rosters. Acclaim released a series of follow-ups to Extreme, most of which were more traditional basketball simulations.</p>"
