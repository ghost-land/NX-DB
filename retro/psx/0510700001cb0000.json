    "description": "<p>Loaded (released as Blood Factory in Japan) is a science fiction-themed top-down shoot &#39;em up video game that was developed by Gremlin Interactive and published by Interplay Productions. Loaded was released on December 12, 1995 on the PlayStation, and was ported to the Sega Saturn the following year. The game had origins in DC Comics as well as the more adult-orientated Vertigo Comics, and there was a small graphic novel based on the game. The six playable characters of the game are a combination of villains, anti-heroes, psychopaths, perverts, mutants, and flamboyant murderers. They are, however, the best hope to stop the intergalactic supervillain nicknamed F.U.B. and save the universe. The characters were created and designed with contributions from Garth Ennis of Vertigo Comics and Greg Staples of 2000AD.<br />\nThe game was notorious for its macabre sense of humor, over-the-top violence and gore, and lighting effects, but was often criticized for the repetitiveness of its gameplay.<br />\nLater in the same year the game spawned a sequel using almost entirely the same characters and the same game engine, albeit one with mildly improved graphics, titled Re-Loaded.</p>"
