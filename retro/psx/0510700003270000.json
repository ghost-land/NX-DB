    "description": "<p>Suikoden II (\u5e7b\u60f3\u6c34\u6ef8\u4f1dII, Hepburn: Gens\u014d Suikoden Ts\u016b) is a role-playing video game developed and published by Konami for the PlayStation video game console and the second installment of the Suikoden video game series. It was released in late 1998 in Japan, 1999 in North America, and in 2000 in Europe. The game features a vast array of characters, with over 100 recruitable characters, of which over 40 are usable in combat, and many more who move the plot forward.<br />\nSuikoden II takes place years after the events of the original Suikoden, and centers on an invasion of the City States of Jowston by the Kingdom of Highland. The player controls a silent protagonist whose name is chosen by the player (named Riou in the Japanese novelization and Drama CD adaptation and Tao in the manga adaptation); he is the adopted son of Genkaku, a hero who saved the City-State of Jowston in a war against Highland years ago. The protagonist and his best friend, Jowy Atreides, each gain one half of the Rune of the Beginning, one of the 27 True Runes of the Suikoden setting, and become caught up in the intrigues of the invasion and the dark fate of those who bear the halves of that Rune.</p>"
