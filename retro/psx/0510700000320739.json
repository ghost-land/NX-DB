    "description": "<p>&quot;Ace Combat&quot; which made &quot;Fun to fly in the sky&quot; very familiar, &quot;Ace Combat 2&quot; which has evolved dramatically beautifully. And now, the latest series &quot;Ace Combat 3 Electrosphere&quot; will inherit this essence. The stage is a near future world where the power of &quot;economy&quot; has jumped far beyond the power of the state. There, the two companies had a mighty power. One is a multinational composite company &quot;General Resources&quot; with a huge capital, with the military industry as the base, and the other is a &quot;Newcom company&quot; with advanced information technology and science and technology as the base. The two companies, which had a subtle tension relationship, finally entered into a state of engagement. The main character (player) belongs to an organization called UPEO [Yupeio], and it fights at fighter plane to suppress the conflict between the two companies.</p>"
