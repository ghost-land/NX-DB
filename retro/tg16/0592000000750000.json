    "description": "<p>\n      Take control of Pac-Man on his home island of Pac-Land and try to help a \n      lost fairy home! Your journey will take you through towns, over rugged \n      mountains, across dangerous ravines and deserts. To make matters worse, \n      the ghosts of Pac-Land will stop at nothing to stand in your way. Once \n      the fairy is safely returned home at the end of the third round of each \n      trip, race back home to clear the round and proceed to the next! There \n      are a total of four trips. Can you complete this fantastical rescue \n      mission and make it back home just in time for dinner?\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
