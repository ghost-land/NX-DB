    "description": "<p>\n      Bomberman '93 is the exciting, powered-up version that followed the \n      original Bomberman! With 6 rounds, each containing 8 stages, the \n      single-player Normal Mode provides all the fun you can handle in its 48 \n      different stages! Blast all of your enemies and find the hidden exit \n      within the time limit to progress to the next stage. The \"kick\" function \n      appears for the first time in this version of Bomberman, and you can \n      really start using cunning tactics in your game play! Make the most of \n      the traps and the new items to beat the game with a perfect record!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
