    "description": "<p>\n      This side-scrolling shooter includes a total of six scenes spanning \n      areas from Earth to the moon. The story begins with a comet discovered \n      in the vicinity of Pluto that is headed on a sudden collision course \n      with Earth. Mankind narrowly succeeds in diverting the comet's course, \n      and it crashes into the moon. However, investigations into the damage \n      uncover that what hit the moon was not a comet, but a gigantic mother \n      ship. Power up your ship, destroy enemies and fight your way through the \n      bosses in an attempt to reach the moon's core and protect Earth from \n      alien invasion. Enjoy the unique world of Dead Moon, including various \n      stages with beautiful backgrounds, a power-up system that increases your \n      attack as well as your defense and bosses that have you altering your \n      ship's direction to fight them.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
