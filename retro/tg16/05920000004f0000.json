Or you can be Jeff. Either way, you&#39;re a wacko detective on a kidnap case who stumbles into some hilarious action. Clues and surprises pop up everywhere. Use your head, your foot (kicking things brings great results) and your secret weapon - the spray-can - on 30 different enemies. So grab some french fries for energy and get ready for action!ii.</p>"
