    "description": "<p>\n      After defeating the Mecha Dragon in the depths of the Dragon Castle, the \n      wounded beast casts a spell on the hero, turning him into an ugly \n      creature. To return to human form, he must find the Salamander Cross, \n      which can break any curse. This side-scrolling action role-playing game \n      is nonlinear, allowing players to venture freely. Collect gold and items \n      while upgrading equipment and powering up stats. The hero starts as \n      Lizard-Man but, upon defeating the dragon bosses, is changed into other \n      creatures such as Mouse-Man, Piranha-Man, Tiger-Man and Hawk-Man. Each \n      creature possesses distinct abilities such as the ability to fly, swim, \n      walk on ceilings or cling to walls. Players use each creature's special \n      skills to widen your search for the Salamander Cross and bring the hero \n      back to his human form!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
