    "description": "<p>\n      Cratermaze is a comical action game set in a parallel world. While on a \n      trip through time, you and your friends are confronted by Kublai, \n      henchman to the evil Zenzombie. He traps your friends at separate points \n      in the space-time continuum. Now you must fight your way through 60 \n      rounds of mazes to save your friends. Dinosaurs, ninjas, robots and \n      other enemies lurk within the mazes, spanning from primitive times to \n      the future. Escape the enemies by digging holes to trap them in and then \n      filling the holes to finish them off. Collect all the chests within the \n      time limit to get the key and exit to the next round. With special items \n      such as shovels and spring platforms, Cratermaze takes its game play to \n      new heights, making for an unforgettable gaming experience.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
