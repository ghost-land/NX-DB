    "description": "<p>\n      Power Golf sports a perfect combination of simple-yet-realistic controls \n      and beautiful graphics. Swing away on 18 lush holes in one of three \n      different game modes: the single player STROKE PLAY mode and the \n      multiplayer MATCH PLAY and COMPETITION modes. Enter tournaments as one \n      of three different characters. Wind strength and the slope of the green \n      add extra challenges to each hole. Compete against other players in the \n      standard NORMAL MATCH or ante up one of your clubs in the unique CLUB \n      MATCH.\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. We hope you'll enjoy the new features (including off-TV play) that have been added to this title. See more Virtual Console games for Wii U.</p>"
