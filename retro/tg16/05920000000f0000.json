    "description": "<p>You&#39;re a death-dealing commando on the mission of your life... rescue the President from an army of terrorist guerrillas. Only you have the guts and firepower to blast through their jungle strongholds... to take out their choppers, snipers and missile launching subs. Make them eat the heat of your flashbombs and explode in the fury of your magnum grenades. The President holds his breath as you begin your final desperate assault. So does the entire world.</p>"
