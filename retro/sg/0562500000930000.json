    "description": "During the first global biowar, a powerful retrovirus filled the planet Avaron with new and deadly forms of life. Only a few survivors remain in O.P. Odysseus, an orbiting platform circling Avaron.<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hundreds of years after the biowar, conditions on Avaron are still hostile but livable. Your mission is to pilot a Bioship to Avaron, fly over the areas that the probes have labeled least hostile, and check out the conditions there."
