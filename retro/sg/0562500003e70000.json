    "description": "Miracles are child's play. Earthquakes are serious fun. The all-powerful can perform miracles in their sleep. But omnipotence isn't what it used to be. These days, it takes awesome natural disasters to dominate a world. You give them good land. You tell them when to farm and when to fight. You make them content beyond their wildest dreams. But then they become raging arsonists. What's a deity to do? Disasters are your divine prerogative - volcanoes, quakes, swamps. For stubborn non-believers, nothing beats a flood for spring cleaning. Cruel ice, lush grassland, parched desert... With 500 worlds, a deity's work is never done.<br/><br/>\nPopulous is the original god-game, a strategy title that lets you shape the isometric isometric world and the fates of its inhabitants. Be sure to check out one of Bullfrog's earliest classics, from the mind of Peter Molyneux!Includes Populous and the Promised Lands expansion.\nBecome a god, assume godly powers, shape civilizations, and make them all bow to your will\nThe power of light or the force of darkness? Holy wrath or divine miracles \u2013 you decide\nPunish the infidels with plagues, earthquakes, and tornadoes. A \u201dlittle\u201d volcano here and there might also convince them as to which god they should pray to"
