    "description": "The tag-team fighting game based on the original \"Umineko When They Cry\" series, finally released on Steam, in English and with improved rollback netplay!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn Golden Phantasia, matches are tag-team fights between two pairs of characters from the Umineko series, each sharing HP building SP for each other through a unique mechanic - the touch system!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nDuring combat players can consume their SP Gauge and initiate their Meta World, but only if your opponent chooses to or otherwise cannot argue their truth and cancel yours! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nGeorge, Jessica, and Rosa from the Ushiromiya family join the fray, as this release of Golden Phantasia includes the Cross Expansion from the original Japanese version! All the lines used during combat, story mode, as well match opening and closings are fully voiced in Japanese to bring realism to your combat! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe 1st Movement is beginning! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nBlitz!"
