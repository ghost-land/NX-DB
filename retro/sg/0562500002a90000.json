    "description": "<p>Last Battle is a side-scrolling martial arts beat 'em up released for the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1989 by Sega. It was one of the six games that were available as part of the Genesis launch lineup in the U.S. The Japanese version, titled Shin Seikimatsu Ky\u016bseishu Densetsu: Hokuto no Ken (\u65b0\u4e16\u7d00\u672b\u6551\u4e16\u4e3b\u4f1d\u8aac \u5317\u6597\u306e\u62f3, lit. \"Fist of the North Star: The New Legend of the Post-Apocalyptic Messiah\"), is based on the manga series Hokuto no Ken (published as Fist of the North Star in English). Since the international version did not retain the Hokuto no Ken license, the graphics and characters' names were altered. It was the second Hokuto no Ken game released by Sega, following the Mark III original (released internationally as Black Belt). Versions for the Commodore 64 and Amiga based upon Last Battle were developed and released by Elite in Europe in 1991.</p>"
