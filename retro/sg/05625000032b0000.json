    "description": "<p>Anything can happen when the most awesome mutants battle to prove who rules the galactic gridiron. 16 vicious teams of aliens, robots, trolls, skeletons and super-humans. Set the &quot;Death Index&quot; from Rough, all the way up to Annihilation. Call wild plays or nasty audibles - when the QB throws a bomb, it&#39;s the real thing! Watch instant replays to see where the body parts land. Throw TNT at the halftime marching band.</p>"
