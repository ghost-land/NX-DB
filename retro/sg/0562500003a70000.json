Though we missed the deadline, feel free to download what we came up with.\u00a0 We are the first game to do 100%\u00a0Hawaiian dialogue with English subtitles.</p><p>It's loosely based on the aftermath of the battle between Poli'ahu (snow goddess of Mauna Kea) and Pele (fire/lava goddess of Kilauea) and the reason why Pele settled in her new home in Kilauea. Have fun and if you'd like us to continue development of this type of project, leave some comments. Mahalo for playing!</p>"
