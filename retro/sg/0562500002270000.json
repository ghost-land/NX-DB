    "description": "<p>Herzog Zwei is a real-time strategy video game developed by Technosoft and published by Sega for the Sega Genesis. An early real-time strategy game, it predates the genre-popularizing Dune II, being released first in Japan in 1989 and worldwide the following year. Herzog Zwei combines the arcade-style play of Technosoft's own Thunder Force series with a simple, easy-to-grasp level of strategy. It has been cited as an inspiration to the developers of Warcraft, Starcraft, and Command &amp; Conquer. It is the sequel to Herzog, which was available on the Japanese MSX and PC-8801 personal computers.</p>"
