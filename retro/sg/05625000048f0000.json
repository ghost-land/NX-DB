It is the 13th game in the franchise.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Like the previous games of the series, no story mode is present in Gran Turismo Sport. Three modes are available to the players: Sports, Arcade, and Campaign.</p>\n<p>Sports mode allows the players to compete with each other online. Polyphony Digital puts a heavy emphasis on the addition of the official FIA Championships set of rules. The players are offered a wide range of events, competitions, and tournaments to participate in. The Sports mode is region locked in order to provide the best experience with as less network lag possible.</p>\n<p>In Arcade mode, the players participate in events they choose on whichever vehicle available in the game against AI opponents. Usual races, Time trials, Drift trials, and two-player split-screen game modes are available to the players.</p>\n<p>The game&#39;s Campaign mode is a classic GT experience. The players have to obtain licenses, buy used cars at first and participate in small championships on their way to the best racing leagues of the world.</p>\n<p>Gran Turismo Sport features 177 vehicles for the players to use. The game has vehicles from all their history, starting with the first car ever produced, Ford Model T.</p>"
