    "description": "<p>Space Harrier II (\u30b9\u30da\u30fc\u30b9\u30cf\u30ea\u30a2\u30fcII, Sup\u0113su Hari\u0101 Ts\u016b) is the sequel to Space Harrier, developed and published by Sega. It was one of the original launch titles released for the Mega Drive in Japan and one of the six Genesis launch titles in the U.S. It was also later released on the Wii's Virtual Console service. Like Altered Beast, another launch title for the Mega Drive, Space Harrier II features digitized human voice recordings during the game play, and is also an example of some of the Mega Drive's early sound, composed by Tokuhiko Uwabo (credited as \"Bo\").</p>"
