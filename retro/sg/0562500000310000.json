The Earth's surface froze over, and humans were forced to live underwater -- where they could still harvest energy and grow food -- changing how cities and districts looked. As resources began to dwindle in the year 2971, sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable planets. Things did not go as planned. And now the ship, Argo9, has returned thousands of years later in a time after humans have gone extinct.<br/><br/>It's up to you to determine whether the ruins of our species is a travesty or an inevitable conclusion as you explore the lush aquatic world and encounter deadly underwater monsters.The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human || Digital DELUXE Edition This edition includes a pixel art map with all the boss locations, the full soundtrack composed by Karl Flodin -- and a digital booklet that gives some extra information about the story, weapons, and upgrades. Lastly, you'll receive a few desktop backgrounds that we made. All of this will be found in the game's folder. <br/>"
