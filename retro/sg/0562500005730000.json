Mixing a shooting-gallery with billiards, platforming and puzzle-solving.<br/>Welcome to Kumoon.<br/>Besides taking potshots at boxes, there's a fair smattering of platforming and wall-climbing. An aggressive default movement speed enables you to make leaps over large gaps. So for those with sturdy VR legs, you can play as wildly as you wish. More sensitive players are given a half speed option to take things a bit slower, and using the analog sticks gently allow you to go as slow as you like.<br/>There are some surprise drops, deep pits, that sort of thing to get a feeling of vertigo.<br/>The levels are all unlocked by default, so players with low tolerance for freedom of movement can pick and choose which levels to play.<br/><br/><strong>Specs</strong><br/><br/>3 Tutorial Levels to get you inside the head of the robot.<br/>15 Easy Levels, to get you acquainted and to have fun with even those holding a gamepad for their first time.<br/>15 Medium Levels, for those comfortable with the controls and willing to forge further.<br/>15 Hard Levels, for aspiring speedrunners, aficionados of intrigue, and those who think pain is the definition of fun."
