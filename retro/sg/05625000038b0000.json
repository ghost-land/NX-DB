    "description": "<p>OutRun 2019 (\u30a2\u30a6\u30c8\u30e9\u30f3 2019) is a Sega Mega Drive/Genesis-only pseudo-sequel to Out Run that takes place in the future. The object is to race against a time limit in a rocket-boosted car across four different stages around the world. Like the original Out Run, there is a fork in the road before each checkpoint; however, there can also be forks within a single route.</p>\n<p>The maximum speed of the car as indicated on the game is 341\u00a0km/h (211.89\u00a0mph) on the Japanese version, 682\u00a0km/h (423.77\u00a0mph) on the European version, and 682\u00a0mph (1097.57\u00a0km/h) on the North American version.</p>"
