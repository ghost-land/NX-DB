    "description": "<p>Warsong, known as Langrisser (\u30e9\u30f3\u30b0\u30ea\u30c3\u30b5\u30fc) in Japan, is a tactical role-playing game developed by Nippon Computer Systems (NCS). The first in the Langrisser series, it blended tactical warfare with RPG elements, similar to the Fire Emblem series. It was initially released for the Mega Drive/Genesis console and the PC Engine (in Super CD-ROM\u00b2 format), the former version being published by Treco in America. The PC-Engine version was released under the title, Langrisser: The Descendants of Light. It was later re-released along Der Langrisser (a remake of Langrisser II) in a compilation for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation. That compilation was released for the PlayStation Network in 2009.</p>"
