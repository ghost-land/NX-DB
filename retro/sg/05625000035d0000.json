    "description": "<p>NFL Quarterback Club is an American football video game for multiple platforms that features quarterbacks from the NFL. It is the first game in Acclaim Entertainment's NFL Quarterback Club series.</p>\n<p>The first game to use the name was a Game Boy title developed by Beam Software and released under Acclaim's LJN brand in 1993 that was a simulation of the NFL Quarterback Challenge. The following year, Acclaim and LJN released a new multiplatform title under the same name, adding options to play full team games under NFL rules, while retaining the Quarterback Challenge mode. The game was released for the Super NES, Genesis and Game Gear. A Game Boy version, called NFL Quarterback Club II and a 32X version were released in 1995. Both these versions omitted the Quarterback Challenge mode, a trend that would continue with NFL Quarterback Club 96.</p>"
