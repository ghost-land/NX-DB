    "description": "<p>Alisia Dragoon (Japanese: \u30a2\u30ea\u30b7\u30a2\u30c9\u30e9\u30b0\u30fc\u30f3, Hepburn: Arishia Dorag\u016bn) is a 1992 platform game developed by Game Arts for the Sega Genesis. The player controls Alisia, a young woman who is on a quest to avenge her father and save the world. She can fire lightning from her hands and summon four faithful beasts to aid her.<br />\nThe game was released outside Japan by Sega, who packaged the heroine as a rugged gladiator instead of the dainty-looking sorceress she originally was. Due to the lack of publicity for the game internationally, Alisia Dragoon did not make a big impact on the video game market, despite the critical acclaim it received.</p>"
