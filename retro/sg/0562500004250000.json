    "description": "<p>Revolution X is an arcade rail shooter game developed and published by Midway in 1994, featuring the rock band Aerosmith. It features gameplay similar to Midway's earlier Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In the game, players battle the oppressive New Order Nation regime and their leader Helga, who have abducted Aerosmith. Players use a mounted gun to control onscreen crosshairs and shoot enemies using compact discs. The members of Aerosmith are hidden throughout the game's international locales and must be found in order to receive the game's true ending.</p>\n<p>The game was a critical and commercial success, and was ported to various consoles as well as DOS computers. These ports were negatively received and reportedly dissuaded Midway from making a sequel.</p>"
