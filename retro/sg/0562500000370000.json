    "description": "<p>Street Fighter II: Champion Edition is a competitive fighting game released for the arcades by Capcom in 1992. It was the first of several updated versions of Street Fighter\u00a0II: The World Warrior, part of the Street Fighter\u00a0II sub-series of Street Fighter games. The main changes were the addition of the Grand Masters (the final four computer-controlled opponents in the single-player mode) as playable characters and mirror matches (vs. matches using the same character). The fighting techniques of the eight main characters from the original game were also further refined to allow for more-balanced competitive play.</p>\n<p>Champion Edition was followed by Street Fighter\u00a0II Turbo: Hyper Fighting, released several months later.</p>"
