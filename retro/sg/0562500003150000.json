    "description": "<p>Minnesota Fats: Pool Legend (released in Japan as Side Pocket 2 (Japanese: \u30b5\u30a4\u30c9\u30dd\u30b1\u30c3\u30c82, Hepburn: Saido Poketto 2)) is a pocket billiards video game for the Sega Genesis and Sega Saturn, featuring famed billiards player Minnesota Fats (as portrayed in \"real-life\" form by Rudolf Wanderone). It was released as a sequel to Data East's earlier success, Side Pocket. The objective in the game is to defeat AI-controlled competitors. The player can also take on another human player in order to prove his worthiness at the pool table.</p>\n<p>The Saturn version of the game largely plays the same as the Genesis version, but includes a training mode, a short documentary on Minnesota Fats, and a completely different plot in the story mode. In the Genesis version the player takes the role of an unnamed rookie pool player seeking to challenge Minnesota Fats, while in the Saturn version the player takes the role of Minnesota Fats himself, and live action full motion videos (FMVs) are used for the cutscenes.</p>"
