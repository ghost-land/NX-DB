    "description": "They were cruising in their highly funky, ultra cool, righteous rapmaster rocketship when Earl said he\u2019d like a shot at driving. To cut a long story short, the rocketship is now in pieces spread over the most insane planet in the galaxy \u2013 planet Earth!<br />\nAll they have to do now is find the ten pieces of their rocketship and they\u2019re on their way. Doesn\u2019t sound so hard does it?</p>"
