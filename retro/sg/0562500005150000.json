It was originally released in 1987 in Japan only under the title Hydlide 3: The Space Memories (\u30cf\u30a4\u30c9\u30e9\u30a4\u30c9\uff13 \u95c7\u304b\u3089\u306e\u8a2a\u554f\u8005, Haidoraido 3: Yami Kara no H\u014dmonsha) for the MSX, MSX2, and NEC PC-88. Ports were also released for the Nintendo Famicom and the Sharp X68000. The game was developed by Hydlide series veterans T&amp;E Soft and released worldwide on the Sega Genesis / Mega Drive on October 6, 1989, in Japan, early 1990 in the United States, and 1991 in Europe. This remake evidences substantial graphical upgrades to the original Hydlide 3, though the gameplay remains largely identical. Before its release, it was called Hollo Fighter in some Sega advertising material and was one of the first third party published titles to be released in the U.S, the other being Air Diver.</p>"
