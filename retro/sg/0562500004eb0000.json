    "description": "<p>Alien marauders are attacking your planet. They&#39;re kidnapping resident humanoids and turning them into mutants! You pilot your ship along the planet surface, blasting away. But first you go for the Landers - the most treacherous of the aliens. You race to the nearest Stargate and whoosh! You experience that eerie - time warp - feeling as you&#39;re transported to the other side of the planet. Only you, with the help of the Stargate, can save the planet against attack!</p>"
