    "description": "<p>Virtua Racing or V.R. for short, is a Formula One racing arcade game, developed by Sega AM2 and released in 1992. Virtua Racing was initially a proof-of-concept application for exercising a new 3D-graphics platform under development, the &quot;Model 1&quot;. The results were so encouraging, that Virtua Racing was fully developed into a standalone arcade title. Though its use of 3D polygonal graphics was predated by arcade rivals Namco (Winning Run in 1988) and Atari (Hard Drivin&#39; in 1989), Virtua Racing had vastly improved visuals in terms of polygon count, frame rate, and overall scene complexity, and displayed multiple camera angles and 3D human non-player characters, which all contributed to a greater sense of immersion. Virtua Racing is regarded as one of the most influential video games of all time, for laying the foundations for subsequent 3D racing games and for popularizing 3D polygonal graphics among a wider audience.</p>\n<p>The original arcade game has three levels, designated into difficulties. Beginner is &quot;Big Forest&quot;, intermediate is &quot;Bay Bridge&quot; and expert is &quot;Acropolis&quot;. Each level has its own special feature, for example the amusement park in &quot;Big Forest&quot;, or the &quot;Bay Bridge&quot; itself, or the tight hairpin of &quot;Acropolis&quot;.</p>\n<p>When selecting a car, the player can choose different transmission types. VR introduced the &quot;V.R. View System&quot; by allowing the player to choose one of four views to play the game. This feature was then used in most other Sega arcade racing games (and is mentioned as a feature in the attract mode of games such as Daytona USA). It was later ported to home consoles, starting with the Mega Drive/Genesis in 1994.</p>"
