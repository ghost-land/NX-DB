On each level there is a hidden \"scooter\" part. in game, Chester can dash and stun many enemies by jumping on their heads.</p>\n<p>The instruction manual contains a popular Engrish that is recognized by many gamers, \"As is Chester Cheetah way, is one-person play.\" The Engrish spawned due to bad translations and an intent to rhyme in a verse form similar to Dr. Seuss' anapestic tetrameter.</p>\n<p>Curiously, no actual mention of the Cheetos snack food is ever made during the course of the game.</p>"
