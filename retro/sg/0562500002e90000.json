    "description": "<p>Master of Monsters is a turn-based strategy game developed by SystemSoft for the MSX and NEC PC8801. It was later ported to a variety of consoles and PCs including the PC Engine, NEC PC9801, Sega Mega Drive (Genesis), Sega Saturn and PlayStation. While it never garnered the same success as its SystemSoft stablemate Daisenryaku, the game garnered a loyal following. Its success in the North American market on the Sega Genesis proved sufficient for a sequel on the Sega Saturn, and an anime art-style enhanced PlayStation version titled Disciples of Gaia with a Japanese role-playing game feel.</p>"
