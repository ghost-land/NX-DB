    "description": "<p>Crusader of Centy (also known as Soleil in Europe and Shin S\u014dseiki Ragnac\u00ebnty (\u65b0\u5275\u4e16\u7d00\u30e9\u30b0\u30ca\u30bb\u30f3\u30c6\u30a3, Shin S\u014dseiki Ragunasenti) (Dawn of the Era: Ragnac\u00ebnty) in Japan) is an action-adventure game that was released on the Genesis/Mega Drive. The story centers on Corona, a boy who has just turned 14 years of age and must inherit his late father's sword to fight the monsters that threaten the human race's very existence. Gameplay takes place in an overhead perspective and focuses on exploring, battling enemies with a sword, and solving puzzles. As the story progresses numerous animals join the hero and aid him, they are used in gameplay like weapons or tools, which often grant passage to previously inaccessible areas. The game's storyline is remarkable for questioning many of the traditional concepts of fantasy role-playing games, such as the presumption that all monsters are inherently evil.</p>"
