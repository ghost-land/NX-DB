    "description": "<p>Joe Montana Football is an American football video game developed by Electronic Arts, and published by Sega for the Genesis in 1991. Although the game does feature Joe Montana (as the title respectively says) as a playable character, since Sega did not secure the rights from the NFL, teams are named generically after US cities, meaning Joe Montana is the only real player in the game.</p>"
