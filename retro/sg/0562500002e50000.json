    "description": "<p>Marvel Land (\u30de\u30fc\u30d9\u30eb\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9, M\u0101berurando) is a platform arcade game released by Namco in 1989; it runs on Namco System 2 hardware, was the company&#39;s last arcade game of the 1980s, and was later ported to the Sega Genesis in 1991 (the EU version was also released under an alternative name of Talmit&#39;s Adventure except in the UK where it retained the name Marvel Land.). It also shares its name with the fictitious kingdom in which the 1986 Japan-only Famicom game Valkyrie no B\u014dken: Toki no Kagi Densetsu took place but has no connections with it otherwise - and it does not have any connections with Marvel Comics and any of the superheroes associated with them, either.</p>"
