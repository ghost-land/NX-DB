    "description": "<p>Heavy Nova (\u30d8\u30d3\u30fc\u30ce\u30d0) is a video game for the Sega CD/Mega-CD, Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, and X68000 that combines elements of fighting games with platform games and mission elements. It was released in 1991 and distributed to Japan and the United States and quickly became known as kusoge. Players assume the role of a robot operator destined to earn the highest operator rank. To do so, the robot \u2013 known in the game as a Heavy DOLL \u2013 must complete a combat training camp which prompts the 2D Platformer stages. The player then must combat other Heavy DOLLs as the end-level bosses which prompts the 2D fighting elements. A sequel for the Sega CD/Mega-CD titled Black Hole Assault was released in 1992.</p>"
