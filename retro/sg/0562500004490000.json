    "description": "<p>Rolling Thunder 2 (\u30ed\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u30b5\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc2, R\u014dringu Sand\u0101 Ts\u016b) is a run and gun arcade game developed and released by Namco for the Namco System 2 hardware in 1990. The game is the sequel to 1986's Rolling Thunder, retaining the same gameplay of its predecessor but adding cooperative gameplay for two players and improved graphics. Unlike the original, which was based in 1968, Rolling Thunder 2 features a more contemporary setting to go along with its more futuristic design, as well as an optionally playable female character. A port for the Mega Drive/Genesis was released in 1991. Both the Mega Drive port and the original arcade game were released for the Wii Virtual Console on December 4, 2007 and October 27, 2009 respectively.</p>"
