    "description": "<p>Michael Jackson&#39;s Moonwalker is the name of several video games based on the 1988 Michael Jackson film Moonwalker. U.S. Gold published various games for home computers, released in 1989, whilst Sega developed two similarly themed beat &#39;em up video games in 1990; one released for arcades and another released for the Mega Drive/Genesis and Master System. Each of the games&#39; stories loosely follow the story of the film, in which Michael Jackson must rescue kidnapped children from the evil Mr. Big, and incorporate synthesized versions of some of the musician&#39;s songs.</p>"
