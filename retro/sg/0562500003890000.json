    "description": "<p>Out Run[a] (also stylized as OutRun) is a racing video game released in arcades by Sega in September 1986. It is known for its pioneering hardware and graphics, nonlinear gameplay, and a selectable soundtrack with music composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi. The goal is to avoid traffic and reach one of five destinations.</p>\n<p>The game was designed by Yu Suzuki, who traveled to Europe to gain inspiration for the game&#39;s stages. Suzuki had a small team and only ten months to program the game, leaving him to do most of the work himself. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming one of the best-selling video games of its time and Sega&#39;s most successful arcade cabinet of the 1980s. It was ported to numerous video game consoles and home computers and spawned a number of sequels. Out Run has been cited as an influence upon later video games.</p>"
