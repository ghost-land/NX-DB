    "description": "<p>For other Superman video games, see List of Superman video games.<br />\nSuperman is an action adventure game for the Atari 2600 designed by John Dunn and published by Atari, Inc. in 1979. It was one of the first single-player games for the system and one of the earliest licensed video games. Superman was built using the prototype code for Warren Robinett&#39;s Adventure, and ended up being published before Adventure was finished. Retro Gamer credits it among action-adventure games as the &quot;first to utilize multiple screens as playing area&quot;.</p>"
