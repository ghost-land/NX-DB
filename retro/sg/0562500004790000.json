Software Planning in 1993. Its storyline is not directly connected to the original Shining Force, although a Game Gear title Shining Force Gaiden: Final Conflict links the two games&#39; plots.<br />\nThe game is much longer than the first and more free-roaming. There is no chapter system, so the player can return to previously visited parts of the world. There are also two different ways of promoting many characters.<br />\nThis game was re-released on the Wii Virtual Console in Europe on October 3, 2008 and in North America on October 6, 2008. It also appears in Sonic&#39;s Ultimate Genesis Collection for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 and as a standalone game on Steam.</p>"
