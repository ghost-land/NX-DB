    "description": "<p>And Yet It Moves is a platform video game which was originally designed as a computer science project at the Vienna University of Technology in 2007. The original prototype of game got various awards and creators decided to create and release a full-version of the game. <br />\nIn this game, players have to move their pencil-drawn character who can run and jump through various hazardous environments. There is an ability to freely rotate the entire game world, like changing floors into walls and every level of the game is built with that having in mind. Also, the spinning of the game world has an effect on the main character as well as the world - walls can become flat, or walkable surfaces may move or react to the change of gravity. The game has a unique paper collage style of visuals and a beatboxing soundtrack made by Christoph Binder. The game was praised for its innovative gameplay mechanics as well as the visuals.</p>"
