    "description": "<p>Skitchin&#39; is a video game for the Sega Genesis, developed and published by Electronic Arts in 1994. The game puts the player in control of an inline skater who has to ride his inline skates while holding onto cars, bikes, and trucks (an act called skitching). Players have this character defending and attacking computer-controlled opponents while racing to the finish. Winning races earns the player&#39;s character money. The game has a similar design structure to other video games such as Road Rash. Following its release, it received generally negative reception.</p>"
