    "description": "<p>Double Switch is an adventure interactive movie video game released for Sega CD, Sega Saturn and Microsoft Windows. The game was produced by Digital Pictures and had a similar \"trap-em-up\" format to Space Panic, Heiankyo Alien, and their earlier game, Night Trap. Apart from the HUD, the graphics consist of live action full motion video clips starring Corey Haim.</p>\n<p>After Digital Pictures' bankruptcy, the games were purchased by a consortium that included visual effects company Flash Film Works. In December 2016, Double Switch was remastered from the original source video and released as an app for Google Play and iTunes.</p>"
