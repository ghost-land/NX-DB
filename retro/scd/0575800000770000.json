    "description": "<p>Formula One World Championship: Beyond the Limit, released in Japan as Heavenly Symphony: Formula One World Championship 1993, is a racing game developed and published by Sega, with production assistance from by Fuji Television, and released for the Sega CD in 1994. As the name implies, the game places the player in the seat of a Formula One car complete with multiple teams and opponents, and all the licensed tracks of the series.</p>\n<p>Beyond the Limit makes heavy use of scaling and rotating background layers and sprites, as well as limited use of texture mapped polygon graphics, with scaling and rotation one of the key features of the Sega CD console. The effect is similar in some respects to Sega arcade games such as Super Monaco GP and Outrun, but far more advanced with the rotation, warping, and textured simple polygon models.</p>"
