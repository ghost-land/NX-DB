    "description": "<p>Driver: San Francisco is the fifth game in the Driver franchise. It is a game about chases with a crime thriller plot.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Plotwise, Driver: San Francisco serves as a sequel to Driver 3 rather than the previous installment, Driver: Parallel Lines. As with the rest of the Driver series, the main character is John Tanner, a police detective, and a talented driver. Tanner is chasing the mobster Charles Jericho who survived the events of Driver 3. </p>\n<p>While awaiting trial in San Francisco, Jericho escapes the custody and wrecks chaos in the city. Tanner is injured and falls into a coma. While unconscious, the protagonist discovers he has a supernatural power to inhabit other people&#39;s bodies. It allows him to continue the chase.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is set in a thoroughly modeled San Francisco complete with its famous landmarks. Unlike in the three previous games, Tanner cannot leave the car and walk around. Instead, Driver: San Francisco introduces a new option called Shift, using which the protagonist instantly changes vehicles. This is explained as a supernatural ability to switch bodies. </p>\n<p>The game also reintroduces the popular Film Director mode. It allows the player to replay his or her adventures using various cameras so that the walkthrough video looks almost like a movie.</p>\n<h3>Multiplayer</h3>\n<p>The game is the first in the series to introduce both local and online multiplayer. There are several modes that include a vehicular tag game and other variations of a competitive chase game.</p>"
