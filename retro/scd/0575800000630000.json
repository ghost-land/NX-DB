    "description": "<p>Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side (also known as Eternal Champions 2 or Eternal Champions CD) is a fighting video game for the Sega CD/Mega-CD. It was published in February 1995 in North America and during the same year in Europe, within the waning days of the platform lifespan.</p>\n<p>The game is a semi-sequel to the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis game Eternal Champions and was part two of a proposed trilogy of games by Sega. Both games were developed by an internal team at Sega named Sega interActive and designed by Michael Lantham, a developer with Sega of America from their early days.</p>\n<p>Eternal Champions: Challenge from the Dark Side includes the nine playable fighters and non-playable boss from the first game, and adds 13 new playable characters (nine of which are hidden) and a new boss. Also, new moves called \"Cinekills\" were added, which are essentially fatalities scenes rendered in full motion video.</p>"
