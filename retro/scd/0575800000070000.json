    "description": "Just how much trouble do you think you could get yourself into if you could be nine years old again knowing... what you know now?\n<br/><br/>\nRemember...\n<br/>\nYour tag-along little sister... Just how hard would you have to push to get her swing to do a loop?\n<br/><br/>\nAncient Ms. Glass' English class... Hey kiddies, can you spell \"cardiac arrest?\"\n<br/><br/>\nGood 'ol mom and dad... Dump 'em fast, dump 'em now, look cute and blame everything on your sister.\n<br/><br/>\nWelcome to the terminally cute, seriously warped world of Willy Beamish. You'll face neurotic yuppie parents, teachers pushed over the edge, a ghostly grandfather back from the grave, the baby-sitter from hell, a pet jumping frog on steroids and a plot to blow the city's sewer system sky high. It's chaotic, it's juvenile, it's definitely deranged and you're gonna love every minute of it.A seriously mental cast of characters\nAn easy-to-use point and click interface \nTraditional cell animation \nHand painted backgrounds\nTruly wicked puzzles \nAn outrageous original soundtrack"
