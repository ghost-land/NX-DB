    "description": "<p>Hang-On (\u30cf\u30f3\u30b0\u30aa\u30f3 Hangu On) is an arcade game designed by Yu Suzuki and released by Sega in 1985. In the game, the player controls a motorcycle against time and other computer-controlled bikes. It was one of the first arcade games to use 16-bit graphics and Sega&#39;s &quot;Super Scaler&quot; technology that allowed pseudo-3D sprite-scaling at high frame rates.[5] It also introduced a motion-controlled arcade cabinet, where the player&#39;s body movement on a large motorbike-shaped cabinet corresponds with the player character&#39;s movements on screen, inspiring arcade games that followed and anticipating the modern motion control trend.[6][1]</p>"
