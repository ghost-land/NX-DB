Look no further, for Line of fire is just what you're looking for!</p>\n<p>Inspired by Plants vs Zombies, try to beat the 5 levels\u00a0and share your stats with your friends. Adjust the difficulty to make it more\u00a0challenging (or easier) to smash those nasty robots.</p>\n<p>This project was made as part of the GameDev.tv Unity 2D Udemy course and, as a student and wannabe gameplay developer, all feedback is welcome.</p>\n<p>Have fun!</p>"
