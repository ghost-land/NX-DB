    "description": "<p>Enduro Racer (\u30a8\u30f3\u30c7\u30e5\u30fc\u30ed\u30ec\u30fc\u30b5\u30fc) is an arcade game from Sega. It was released in 1986 with either a stand up cabinet with handlebars or a full-sized dirt bike on the cabinet itself. Many people see it as essentially the dirt version of Hang-On, as it uses a similar engine and PCB.</p>"
