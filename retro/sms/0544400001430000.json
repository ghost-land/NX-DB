    "description": "<p>This a port of the <em>classic</em> game Snail Maze, It was originally a hidden game within the Sega Master System's BIOS, but it was eventually removed due to memory constraints and never got a cartridge release.<br/> <br/>I made this port because I needed a nice and simple game to create for my first project in Godot,\u00a0and with that,\u00a0I hope you enjoy your descent into madness as you attempt to beat this god forsaken game.<br/><br/>(Please don't sue me Sega, it's just Snail Maze)</p>"
