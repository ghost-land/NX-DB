    "description": "The Bonanza Bros., Mike and Spike, are two of the most famous investigators around. One day, they received a strange phone call.<br/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t  \u201cI can\u2019t give you my name. I\u2019ll just tell you that I\u2019m a businessman with a problem. Many of my properties have been targets for robbery recently. I don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve been hit, but it\u2019s become quite a costly situation. I need the two of you, the renowned Bonanza Brothers, to test my security forces. I have already had various items \u2014 money, papers and the like \u2014 placed randomly in ten of my establishments. Your job is to retrieve every single item. If you succeed, the reward will make Fort Knox look like pocket change. Good luck...\u201d"
