    "description": "<p>Psychic World is a platform game wherein the player&#39;s character Luc\u00eda runs from one stage to the other using her &quot;ESP Booster&quot; to blast monstrous enemies while obtaining item power-ups through them or by jumping on various ledges and platforms. The Booster has a gauge of how often certain items and abilities can be used, but that, as with her health, can be replenished by power-ups. All her weapons are upgradeable by merely picking up the same item for that particular weapon and new weapons are obtained through mini-bosses and end-level bosses. The player has to use Lucia&#39;s psionic weapons strategically in levels using different elements to their advantage (in the ice stage, rocks being doused by falling water can be frozen and used as a stable platform for Luc\u00eda to jump on by blasting the rock with the ice shot, while the sonic wave weapon can destroy certain foreground objects blocking her path).</p>"
