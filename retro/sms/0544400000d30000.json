    "description": "<p>Master of Darkness is a platform game, very similar to Castlevania. The plot has the player entering the role of a Ouija board-playing psychologist named Dr. Ferdinand Social, who is looking to defeat Count Dracula, who is behind a series of killings in London that have been attributed to Jack the Ripper. However, Jack the Ripper is indeed responsible, for he is using the victim&#39;s bodies and fresh blood for sacrificial offerings \u2013 as part of a dark ritual being performed by Count Massen to resurrect Dracula. Also taking some part in the murders and the dark ritual is a mysterious Psychic Girl, who is possessed by an evil Skull Spirit.</p>"
