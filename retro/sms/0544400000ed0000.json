    "description": "<p>Mortal Kombat is a fighting game focused on one-on-one matches known for its gore elements. It\u2019s the first title in the series that consists of multiple sequels and spin-offs. The plot follows Liu Kang, a monk who needs to defeat evil mage Shang Tsung and save the world. To do so, he takes part in the deadly tournament called Mortal Kombat and has to fight every participant over to get to Shang Tsung and his monstrous ally Goro.<br />\nThere are seven playable characters in Mortal Kombat, however, unlike in other fighting games, each of them has almost the same stats with a small difference in abilities. The core feature of the game is its unique control scheme that includes not only using buttons but also moving a joystick in eight directions. Every character has a set of attacks which can be performed by tapping a combination of buttons and the joystick&#39;s moves. The most-known element of the fight is so-called Fatality that allows brutally finishing the defeated opponent.</p>"
