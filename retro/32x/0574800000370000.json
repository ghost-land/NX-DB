    "description": "<p>Spot Goes to Hollywood is a platform video game developed by Eurocom and published by Acclaim Entertainment in North America and Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Europe for the Mega Drive/Genesis as the sequel to Cool Spot. A Sega Saturn and PlayStation version was later released, and featured FMV clips and different levels but similar gameplay to the original version. Sega 32X and SNES versions were also in development but got canceled before release. It utilizes an isometric graphics system to provide a pseudo-3D playing experience. The player controls Spot, once the mascot for the 7 Up soft drink, as he travels to various places trying to free his friends.</p>"
