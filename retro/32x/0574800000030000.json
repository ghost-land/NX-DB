    "description": "<p>Spider-Man: Web of Fire is a video game released exclusively for the Sega 32X and based on the popular Marvel Comics character Spider-Man. It was the last game released for the 32X system in North America.<br />\nThe player controls Spider-Man through six stages of side-scrolling levels as he goes up against the Neo-Nazi organization H.Y.D.R.A. and their hired hands the New Enforcers. Hydra has taken all of New York hostage as they have set up generators throughout the city which has caused a giant electrical grid to be placed over New York trapping its citizens. The New Enforcers are each guarding the generators to make sure Hydra&#39;s plans go uninterrupted. At the end of the levels Spider-Man must go up against each member of the New Enforcers while destroying each generator. The bosses are Dragon Man, The Eel, Thermite, Blitz, Tangle, and Super-Adaptoid. Vanisher also appears although he is not a boss. The player can also get assistance from fellow superhero Daredevil by collecting &quot;DD&quot; tokens.<br />\nThe character graphics were rendered on Silicon Graphics workstations, using motion captured animation.</p>"
