    "description": "<p>Darxide (sometimes spelled DarXide, pronounced \"dark side\") is a shoot 'em up for the Sega 32X by Frontier Developments, released in 1995 only in Europe. It was also scheduled to be a launch title for the unreleased Sega Neptune.</p>\n<p>Gameplay is similar to that of Asteroids, only in 3D. Players must destroy a number of space rocks (and on some occasions flying saucers) in order to complete each level.</p>\n<p>One of the last games released for the 32X, Darxide is one of the few games on the 32X that uses texture mapping.</p>\n<p>It was followed in 2004 by Darxide EMP, an expanded version released for Pocket PCs and Nokia mobile phones.</p>"
