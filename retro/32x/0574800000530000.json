    "description": "<p>Zaxxon's Motherbase 2000 (known simply as Motherbase in Europe and Parasquad in Japan) is a shoot 'em up released in 1995 for the Sega 32X. It is the only Zaxxon game to use polygon graphics, though it still uses an isometric perspective as seen in previous games in the series, and relies on 2D graphics for the backgrounds and scenery.</p>"
