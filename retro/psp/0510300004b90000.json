    "description": "<p>&quot;Tony Stark had it all: a genius mind, fame, and even a multinational<br />\ncorporation. But his life would soon change forever. During a routine<br />\nweapons test in the Middle East, power-hungry militants led a violent<br />\nambush against Tony and claimed him as their prisoner. Armed with Stark<br />\nIndustries weaponry, Tony\u2019s new foes demanded he construct a new<br />\nultimate weapon for them. Instead, with the help of fellow captive<br />\nYinsen, Tony built his own ultimate weapon \u2013 a powerful suit of armor<br />\nthat served as the key to his heroic escape.</p>\n<p>After returning home, Tony\u2019s near-death experience drastically altered<br />\nhis outlook on life. The attack against Tony \u2013 with his own creations,<br />\nno less \u2013 inspired him to cease production of all Stark Industries<br />\nweapons, despite the protests of longtime family</p>\n<p>friend and mentor Obadiah Stane. And that wasn\u2019t all. Aided by his<br />\ncharming assistant, Pepper Potts, and equipped with a new suit even more<br />\nadvanced than the one used in his escape, Tony took it upon himself to<br />\ndestroy all Stark weapons in enemy hands \u2013 personally. He became more<br />\nthan a man. He became Iron Man.</p>\n<p>&quot;</p>\n<p>Become a one man army as the unstoppable Iron Man! Customize your suit<br />\nand battle against armies of fighter jets, tanks, armored Super Villains<br />\nand more. Blast into hardcore shooting action and explosive combat from<br />\nthe film as well as exclusive content created just for the game.</p>"
