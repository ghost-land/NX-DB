    "description": "<p>Lord of Apocalypse takes place in a world called Horodyn, named after the land&#39;s first king. Somewhere in Horodyn lies an ancient stone known only as &quot;Arcana&quot;, which apparently holds great magical power. Unfortunately, as well as humans, the world is home to many great and powerful monsters and beasts, which are fought by warriors known as Slayers who seek Arcana.</p>"
