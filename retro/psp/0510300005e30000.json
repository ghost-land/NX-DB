    "description": "<p>(Online Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB)  The Games on Demand version supports  English, French.  Could this be the best football game ever? PES 2012&#39;s Active AI is always looking to support attacks and provide options for the most satisfying gameplay experience. Off the Ball Control makes you the target man in dead ball situations and Teammate Control gives you control over additional players. These and loads more improvements make for the most complete PES so far.</p>"
