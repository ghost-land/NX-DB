    "description": "<p>Once, you were the fastest rising star of the TNA iMPACT wrestling scene. You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and everyone in your way, but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you\u2019ve woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico and you can\u2019t remember a thing. Lost and on your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you\u2019ve got at getting home. But once you\u2019re in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</p>"
