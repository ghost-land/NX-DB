    "description": "<p>M.A.C.H.: Modified Air Combat Heroes is an air combat sim. It takes place in the year 2049. Warring governments try to save lives by using only unmanned aircraft, which means thousands of planes and jets become grounded and useless. On the black market, they fetch high prices as ex-fighter pilots who are now without a job form an underground movement, and race and fight in illegal competitions for fame and fortune.</p>\n<p>By defeating rivals, players can improve their character and unlock new planes and parts to upgrade them with. Multiplayer modes include Arcade Mode (Quick Action), Career Mode (Tournaments), Challenge Mode (five challenges per tier) and Dogfight Mode.</p>"
