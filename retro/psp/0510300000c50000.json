    "description": "<p>Tomb Raider: Anniversary retraces Lara Croft&#39;s original genre-defining adventure \u0097 globe-trotting 3rd person action-adventure in pursuit of the legendary Scion artifact. Using an enhanced &#39;Tomb Raider: Legend&#39; game engine, the graphics, technology and physics bring Lara&#39;s adventure and pursuit of a mystical artifact known only as the Scion right up to today&#39;s technology standards and offers gamers a completely new gameplay experience. Re-imagined, Anniversary delivers a dynamic fluidly and fast Lara Croft, massive environments of stunning visuals, intense combat and game pacing, and an enhanced and clarified original story.<br />\nEpic Exploration - The lost city of Atlantis and ancient Egyptian pyramids are ripe for discovery: explore every hidden dark crevice and impossible heights; enter into strange, undiscovered lands and solve their deepest, darkest mysteries; open doors to new realms, uncover great rewards and unearth secrets to Lara&#39;s past.<br />\nAcrobatic Gunplay - Deftly leap around charging enemies while you unleash a hail of bullets from your trademark dual pistols.<br />\nLethal Predators - The wilderness awaits with a wide range of bestial predators\u0097from bats to wolves to bears\u0097ready to defend their territory from human encroachment. New and improved AI means that all enemies will exhibit a more diverse behaviour set, providing improved combat challenges for the player.<br />\nSupernatural elements are used sparingly to provide a mystical allure around the world, while maintaining the world&#39;s grounded core. The awesome T-Rex and intriguing Atlantean centaurs suck you in to the wonderfully intriguing and mysterious world of Tomb Raider.<br />\nDeath-Defying Environmental Playground - Leap over massive gaps, cling onto rock ledges, and swim through underground tunnels.<br />\nSolve the Diabolical Machinery of the Past - seek to outwit the brilliant ancient designers of many epic puzzles and vaults in order to uncover their secrets. Be warned that they do not take kindly to &#39;meddling&#39;, and as such, the price of failure is extreme.</p>"
