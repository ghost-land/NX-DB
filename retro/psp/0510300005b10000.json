    "description": "<p>The world is going to end in 30 Seconds, our only hope is Priscilla and a fairy Time Manipulation powers. Created for the One Map Game Challenge on RPG Maker Forums.</p>\n<p>This game is heavily inspired by\u00a0Marvelous Entertainment's \"Half-Minute Hero\" series, which is a RPG that\u00a0streamlines the core JRPG\u00a0mechanics to a satirical degree.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This is a complete game by the standards of the One Map Game Challenge, but it's also a potential tech demo/proof of concept of trying to mimic \"Half-Minute Hero's\" game mechanics in RPG Maker. I would love to expand on this and turn it into a larger game.</p>"
