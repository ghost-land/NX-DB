    "description": "<p>The first hi-res 2D fighter from the creators of the Guilty Gear series! BlazBlue is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as &quot;the Library,&quot; which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways.<br />\nA round is called a &quot;rebel&quot; and one match can consist of one to five &quot;rebels&quot;. To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent&#39;s health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a &quot;unique&quot; technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character.<br />\nKey Features<br />\n12 unique batants to choose from! - Choose a character that represents your own fighting style like the lightning-fast Taokaka or the wickedly powerful Tager.<br />\nDrive your way to victory! - Use the unique Drive Attacks specific to each character to decimate your opponent.
