    "description": "<p>Napoleon: Total War is a turn-based strategy game with real-time tactic elements.</p>\n<h3>Plot and setting</h3>\n<p>The game takes place in early 19 century, during the conquests of Napoleon Bonaparte. There are four playable campaigns, wherein two, the player can choose between different countries of interest, and lead their troops in the Wars of Coalition, and the other two smaller campaigns focus on Napoleon\u2019s earlier conquests. Each campaign has a set of missions to accomplish, with different objectives and varying difficulty.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>As with other games of Total War series, there are two main game modes, the geopolitical turn-based mode, where the player has to build up his cities, recruit armies and plan their conquests, and the battle mode, where the player can manually command his troops to outplay the enemy in tactics. There are many variables in combat, as units may take attrition, can have lower morale according to the current situation on the battlefield, and so on.</p>\n<h3>Graphics and other features</h3>\n<p>The game features a multiplayer mode, where players take control of the different countries from the period, and face against each other, engage in diplomacy, forge unlikely alliances, and many more. The engine of the game redefines battles, as the physics have improved, leaving a great impact on how the game looks. Cannon strikes leave craters, guns fire in unison; troops fall from a successful flanking, everything in battle now has a certain feel, as if you are really on the field.</p>"
