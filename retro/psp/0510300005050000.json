    "description": "<p>Spectral Vs. Generation is a cross over fighting game developed in 2005 by International Games System(IGS) a company based in Taiwan known mainly for their side scroll beat&#39;em up Knights of Valor. S.V.G was based on two turn-based tactics games that took place in the same universe, Spectral Force(PS1) and Generation Of Chaos(PS2) developed by Idea Factory.</p>\n<p>S.V.G&#39;s style seems greatly influenced by the popular air dashing fighting game Guilty Gear though it certainly has a few unique features of its own. The game originally started out in Arcades and would be ported to the Playstation 2 and Playstation Portable consoles 2 years later but was only released in Japan and Europe.</p>"
