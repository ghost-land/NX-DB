    "description": "<p>Ape Escape Academy 2 is the next stage in monkey mayhem on PSP. Players join the monkeys following their graduation from the &#39;Ape Academy&#39; as they square off in a zany &quot;Scissors, Paper, Stone&quot; card battle! Play 100 new mini games. Collect up to 300 monkey cards. Give your mate a taste of monkey madness by sending them a special mini game via the Game Sharing mode. Play two players on one PSP using the special monkey-shield provided to make sure your opponent doesn&#39;t see what cards you have.</p>"
