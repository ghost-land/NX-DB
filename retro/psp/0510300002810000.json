    "description": "<p>SCE Studios Liverpool brings the future back with this second Wipeout game for the PSP. This entry in the racing series features 24 new reversible circuits, a load of fresh high-speed vehicles and some deadly new weaponry. There&#39;s also a new track feature called the Mag-Strip, which acts like a magnet and temporarily locks ships to the levels, enabling exciting things like loops and vertical drops.</p>"
