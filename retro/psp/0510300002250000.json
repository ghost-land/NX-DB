Build a rescue team to take on mysterious, changing dungeons and strategically plan your moves as you venture forth to make the Pok\u00e9mon world a safer place\u2026and uncover your true purpose along the way.</p>\n<p>As you recruit Pok\u00e9mon, these trusty teammates will need somewhere to stay, so build camps to house, manage, and strengthen your Pok\u00e9mon friends. Think hard about who is right for the job and how to approach each mysterious dungeon as you prepare a rescue team. You\u2019ll move a single square at a time or use Auto mode to speed up movement until you engage other Pok\u00e9mon in turn-based battles\u2014but don\u2019t forget about Pok\u00e9mon strengths and weaknesses! This version adds gorgeous watercolor-inspired graphics, and more! Get comfortable in being a Pok\u00e9mon, there\u2019s a lot of work to do.</p>"
