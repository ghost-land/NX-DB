    "description": "<p>The game takes place at Habataki High School seven years after Tokimeki Girl&#39;s Side 1. There are a total of six new bachelors plus three secret characters.<br />\nTMGS 3 implements a totally new system; the Love Triangle. Instead of rival girls liking your man, all six bachelors are paired with another, making it so that you can &#39;date&#39; two of them at a time. TMGS 3 also introduces a revamped clothing system with a few new clothing styles and the ability to &#39;level up&#39; your fashion.</p>"
