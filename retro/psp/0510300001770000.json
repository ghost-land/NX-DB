    "description": "<p>Bring your A-game on this hunt - you\u2019re on camera. In Cabela&#39;s\u00ae North American Adventures your search for trophy game is captured on film as an expert cameraman records your adventures. It\u2019s hunting taken to the extreme with record-class opportunities in situations meant only for the pros. To make the hunt even more challenging, you not only have to wait for the right gun or bow shot opportunity; you must make sure the cameraman perfectly frames the action. You\u2019ll hunt more than 30 game species across ten North American regions from Alaska to Mexico. Use cover and stealth to close the distance on elusive trophies, and expert duck calling in an action-packed mallard hunt. When your trophy\u2019s down, relive the moment by watching an exciting video of the hunt\u2019s highlights. Also featured are arcade-style shooting galleries and a Big Trophy Tournament where your persistence and skill as a hunter can help you bring down record-sized racks.<br />\nActivision is a registered trademark of Activision Publishing, Inc.
