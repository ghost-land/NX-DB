    "description": "<p>As Nippon Ichi Software\u2019s first pure action game, Prinny is the most heart- pounding and challenging sidescrolling action game ever. Players will control an unlucky penguin dude called a Prinny and slash their way through various Netherworlds.  For this tough-as-nails action game, you\u2019re given 1000 units to accomplish your mission, but even with those 1000 units you will have to use everything you find on the battlefield to survive. Lift and throw objects, stomp enemies, even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way!<br />\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
