    "description": "<p>Long, long ago, there was an ancient kingdom called Ys which prospered under the auspices of two heavenly Goddesses. Over time, the kingdom came to be known as Esteria, and its divine history was largely forgotten by all but the descendants of those who once preached the Goddesses&#39; will. The only reminder of this lost lore was a cursed spire at the foot of a giant crater, which locals came to regard as &quot;The Devil&#39;s Tower.&quot;</p>"
