    "description": "<p>Valkyria Chronicles takes place during the early period of World War II in a fictional region which is in Europa. The peaceful nation of Gallia is attacked by East European Imperial Alliance because of Ragnite ore which is a petrol in the game&#39;s universe and which Gallia nation has a lot. The main focus of Valkyria Chronicles plot is the resistance against Imperial Army. <br />\nOne of the game&#39;s selling point is the visual style which is similar to cell-shading and looks like it all was drawn with a pencil. This is one of those &quot;playable anime&quot; kind-of games. The gameplay itself is fun yet difficult if a player doesn&#39;t know what to do. It is turn-based and every turn should be well-measured. There are phases of player characters and of enemies. Wins that which is planning his turns more thoughtful. The game also has a strong anti-war message.</p>"
