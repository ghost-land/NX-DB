Featuring the crazy characters from the Ape Escape series, Ape Academy takes you a college filled with minigames, troublemakers, and challenges. You can achieve success by winning games such as trivia quizzes and variants of dodgeball, pong, and rock-paper-scissors. The game also lets you take on other PSP players via Wi-Fi connection, or play against a friend simultaneously on one PSP.</p>"
