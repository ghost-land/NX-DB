Couple this with all-new \n      signature go-to moves that capture the essence of the NBA's best, and \n      you can now play the game on a console like you see it from the stands. \n      All-new shooting mechanics - from deep three-point shots well beyond the \n      arc to 10-foot jump shots in the paint, every shot attempt has been \n      redesigned to provide more fluid, realistic results. Dunks and lay-ups \n      are now assigned to the same button command making highlight reel plays \n      even easier to perform. Running at a smooth 60 frames per second, NBA \n      LIVE 08 is as close as you can get to the court, without dropping a dime \n      for courtside seats. Player faces, team uniforms, and authentic arenas \n      jump to life behind the power of next-generation game graphics.
