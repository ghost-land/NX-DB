Occasionally for those who possess Demon Weapons, pressing the prompted on-screen button will increase the power gauge After gaining enough power, you may perform a soul resonance. This enables your character to perform super moves. When the gauge is full and you perform a resonance while close to the opponent, you will initiate the ultimate attack.</p>"
