    "description": "<p>Thrillville\u2122: Off the Rails lives up to its name with 20 death-defying rides so outrageous, they inspire the same word from every park visitor who sees them:  \u201cWHOA!\u201d Players build these incredible \u201cWHOA Coasters\u201d to leap from one track to another, launch through the air like cannonballs, blast through a burning ring of fire and more.<br />\nBut the new fun doesn\u2019t stop there. Off the Rails features 34 playable multiplayer minigames, 15 all-new theme areas, over 40 thrill rides, a new story that ties together more than 100 missions, and social interaction with park guests that\u2019s better than ever. The in-depth conversations both advance the plot and suggest better ways to manage the park. But is every guest to be trusted?<br />\nExperience the visceral fun of interacting with a theme park you create.<br />\nBuild and ride your own creations, talk and joke with all your guests, and play dozens of minigames.<br />\nVisit 15 themed areas, like Battleville, Winterville, Spaceville and Aeroville, all spread throughout five new parks.<br />\nCreate 20 death-defying WHOA Coasters such as:<br />\nHotrod Stunt - A nitro boost propels a car across a broken track.<br />\nPendulizer - A giant arm grabs the car just before a gap in the track, whips it around in a full circle, then sets it down on the other side.<br />\nEscape Drop  - The track holds the car stationary as it lifts itself from level ground to a full 90-degree drop. Then it lets go.<br />\nDistinguish your rides even more with enhanced customization options. Attach animatronics, flowers and flaming hoops to all of your coasters and rides.<br />\nPlay 34 minigames \u2013 14 new, 20 returning from the original Thrillville but with new levels.</p>"
