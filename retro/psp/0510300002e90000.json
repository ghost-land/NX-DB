    "description": "<p>Hind-Sight is an abstract game that represents how we make decisions and how we can chose a different path to get to the same outcome.</p>\n<p>For each cube you collect a version of you , your former self will be created to walk the path you make. Will you cross paths with your past self and be overcome with indecision(and die) ? Or will you trek a new path and avoid your past decisions?\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use of The Theme : 2020</p>\n<p>There's a saying \"Hindsight is always 20/20\"\u00a0 which means the paths taken are always clearer than the ones untraveled in our future.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p>\n<p>CONTROLS :</p>\n<p>You can exit the game any time by hitting Escape on your keyboard or \"O\"/\"B\" on your controller\u00a0</p>"
