    "description": "<p>The peaceful world of the LocoRoco\u2122 are under attack by the not-so-nice Moja Corps! These evil outer space creatures have come to take the LocoRoco from their land of blowing flowers, lively creatures and pastel scenery. You must move the LocoRoco through more than 40 levels of slippery slopes, teetering platforms, and maze-like passages. The LocoRoco have the uncanny ability to fluidly morph to their landscape, so all you need is to tilt, roll, and bounce the happy blob-like creatures to safety.<br />\nTake advantage of LocoRoco in native 4K on your PlayStation\u00ae4 Pro system and compatible 4K display.
