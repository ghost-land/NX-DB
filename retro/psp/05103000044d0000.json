    "description": "<p>Dead to Rights: Reckoning returns to crime-infested Grant City, as an important informant is kidnapped on the eve of the investigation of a major crime lord. Anticipating the worst if the crime boss is not brought to justice, Jack Slate and his K-9 companion Shadow thrust themselves into hostile gang territory to save the informant and bring peace to the City. Dead to Rights: Reckoning expands upon the blistering action of the series with a robust ranged and melee fighting system that allows Jack to spit lead and bust heads with ease, and an all-new selection of weapons and lethal disarms. Players will also have unprecedented control of Shadow, utilizing him to watch Jack&#39;s back and unleash savage canine fury on lowlife thugs. For the first time in the series Dead to Rights: Reckoning allows players to go head to head through wireless multiplayer death matches, adding hours of replay value to an already extensive single player campaign.</p>"
