    "description": "<p>Johnny Knoxville and the jackass crew are knee deep in their latest series of ill-conceived stunts, pranks and acts of indecency, and this time you&#39;re in the director&#39;s seat. Take control of your favorite degenerates through a massive range of all-new challenges. An onslaught of absurd situations lower the bar and up the ante for the self-inflicted injury, degradation and low moral caliber you&#39;ve come to love and expect from this special group of idiots.</p>"
