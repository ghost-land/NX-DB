    "description": "<p>The divine conflict between Harmony and Discord rages on, the fate of the world it&#39;s promised prize.<br />\nFighting to secure it are brave souls summoned for that solitary purpose.<br />\nChampions, cut from cloth different from those which form the fabric of our world.<br />\nThese warriors from afar are helpless but to do as bid, waging battle after endless battle for the gods who called them here, granted neither respite nor reprieve.<br />\nRelying on what fragments of their shattered memories remain, they fight to end the conflict, and for a chance to return home, to the worlds they each once knew.<br />\nWhat they cannot know is that they fight in vain. This war is one without end, and it is their fate to serve<br />\nforever, until, at last, their ebbing strength gives way...<br />\nSome functions and features may not be available on PlayStation TV.<br />\nSoftware subject to license (us.playstation.com/softwarelicense).
