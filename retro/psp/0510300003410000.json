    "description": "<p>Dante&#39;s Inferno is a slasher role-playing game developed by Visceral game.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri. The players control Dante, a veteran of crusades, looks for his beloved Beatrice who got taken by Lucifer. As Dante descends deeper into Hell, he has to face more and more horrific creatures, his own sins and the dark history of his family.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay of Dante&#39;s Inferno is similar to most slayer games. The core mechanics of the genre are to control a character who traverses different locations and eliminates every enemy they find on their path (demons in this case). The protagonist&#39;s weapons are long-ranged, allowing for the mass murder of their enemies. </p>\n<p>The boss battles in the game are heavily inspired by God of War, where the player firstly fights with the boss and later uses a quick-time event to finish their enemy off. </p>\n<p>Multiple platforming puzzles are present in the game. The levels itself consist of multiple interconnected platforms. There are numerous spots where the players have to jump to, not without using their weapons on several occasions. </p>\n<p>Two weapons are present in the game: the Death&#39;s Scythe and a Holy Cross, which differ both in their usage and their role in the game&#39;s character progression system. Both weapons have their own upgrade trees which require souls. Souls can be acquired by killing enemies with one of the weapons.</p>"
