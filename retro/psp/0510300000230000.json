Heaven series of games. The game was later introduced to Nintendo&#39;s Game Boy Advance in 2004, which Atlus USA released in North America in 2005. An enhanced remake was released for the PlayStation Portable in November 2006, and was released in July 2007 in North America by Atlus USA. Riviera: The Promised Land became a sleeper hit because of its twist to the RPG standard.<br />\nThe player takes the role of Ein, a Grim Angel, who must battle against demons as well as antagonistic Grim Angels to seal away the four fountainheads of evil known as the Accursed. He is accompanied by four heroines\u2014Fia, Lina, Serene and Cierra\u2014as well as his cat-like familiar Rose. Riviera also contains dating sim elements, as the hero can achieve multiple endings with the supporting characters through decisions made throughout the game.</p>"
