    "description": "<p>While these three nations vie for continental domination, one captain must choose a nation with which to align him/herself, then recruit teams of able-bodied soldiers and train them into battle-ready knights to send off into the ever-changing online war campaign. It is up to players to choose an allegiance with one of the three factions, then progress through offline questing and intense 30-hour online skirmishes, all making use of deep, strategic RPG combat and expansive customization. Race, sex, appearance, job class, sub-class and weapon type are all freely alterable for every team member, so no two knights are ever the same; and unique massively-multiplayer online functionality allows players to test their knights against others from all corners of North America, without even requiring a constant internet connection</p>"
