Make your way up to party city through exotic beaches, steep cliffs and snowy slopes, destroying their structures in the most spectacular way to earn those all-important stars.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nChoose from different angles to make your slingshot, using classic Angry Birds gameplay elements to progress and strive for the best possible score. Tough boss pigs, balloons, boulders and fans make each level a challenging puzzle in its own right. And using the bird\u2019s special skills - like Chuck\u2019s super speed or Bomb\u2019s explosive power - will help you earn maximum points.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nStay tuned for more levels. The adventure starts here!"
