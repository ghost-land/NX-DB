    "description": "<p>The extra-terrestrials in this game are anything but friendly. They&#39;re slimy monsters that are holding space colonists captive aboard seven alien starships. This super action game challenges you to free the helpless hostages. Search each ship&#39;s deadly levels, using flamethrowers and laser cannons to vaporize alien scum. Look for maps to help you find your way. After you&#39;ve saved all the captives from one ship, you must destroy its powerful leader before you can move on to the next ship. Remember, to the aliens, you&#39;re slime. And they want you good... and dead!</p>"
