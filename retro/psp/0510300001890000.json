    "description": "<p>A spin-off from Sega&#39;s Yakuza series. Kurohyo has similar mini-games to the main series with bowling, claw machine, and batting center. Hostess clubs have returned now with and interaction for a Kiss depending how highly hearted the hostess is.<br />\nKUROHYO is an action adventure game set in Kamurocho, a huge red-light district swirling with human greed and ambition. The main character is Tatsuya Ukyo, a boy who only knows how to express himself through violence. An act of indiscretion by Tatsuya sets the story in motion, eventually leading him to face his destiny as a fighter. Tatsuya&#39;s story is told in epic style through over 300 minutes of fully voiced event movies. The main plot is enriched by over 100 sub-stories, and Kamurocho is brought to life in realistic detail thanks to countless corporate tie-ins and playspots like cabaret clubs. The battle scenes are as gritty and action-packed as a real street fight. Intuitive controls infuse each punch, kick, and throw with adrenaline-charged excitement.</p>"
