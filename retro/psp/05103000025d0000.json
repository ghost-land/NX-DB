    "description": "<p>LPB is a pseudo-3d puzzler-platformer exclusive for consoles from Sony Computer Entertainment. It was developed by British Media Molecule studio who before LPB developed only one semi-experimental game Ragdoll Kung-Fu. The game tells a story about the adventures of Sackboy, but there is no actual plot to follow in the game. The main focus is on the gameplay.</p>\n<p>The game bets on user-generated-content and invites everyone to add something of their own to it. Each new level is a new story, and the ability to create your own levels with the built-in editor greatly increases the time spent playing. You can go through the game alone or with your friends: on one console or using online services.</p>\n<p>In addition to the level editor, players can customize the Sackboy to their taste. In the creation of costumes for the main character of the game participated other developers: for example, Supermassive Games, Fireproof Games, Tarsier Studios.</p>"
