    "description": "<p>Action meets strategy as you take on London&#39;s fiercest gangs in a bid for domination of the capital. With the opportunity to play as one of five gangs, you have to use brains and brawn to overcome the rival criminal factions and gain control of the city&#39;s underworld. Become the guv&#39;nor of the Cockney, Triad, Yardie, Russian or Pakistani gangs and take on the capital over a number of unique and challenging game modes: Core Action Game - Choose the gang you want to lead, be prepared to fight dirty and use your head to stay one step ahead of the competition. Each mission is separated with stunning graphic-novel style narratives that guide you through the background story of criminal masterminds fighting for the right to be called Mr Big - London&#39;s number one gangster. Gangs of London also offers a turn-based strategy game which brings something completely new to PSP. Using a combination of skill, nerve and chance, gamers can take on up to four other gamers on a single PSP - or compete against the PSP controlled AI. Free Roaming mode allows you to explore and tackle the streets of London on your own terms - take your pick of character, vehicle, weapons, mission objectives, weather conditions and police levels, but be careful when exploring enemy turf.</p>"
