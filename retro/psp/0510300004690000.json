Known as &quot;Sensei&quot; he is both Shiren&#39;s uncle and his master, having taught him the way of the blade. Sensei offers Shiren a key that is said to unlock the legendary Karakuri Mansion, a labyrinth of dangerous traps, fell beasts, and treasure untold.</p>\n<p>Shiren excepts the key, the wanderlust inside him striking his heart like lightning as he holds it in his hand. But this is only the calm before the storm...</p>"
