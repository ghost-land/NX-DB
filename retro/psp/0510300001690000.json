    "description": "<p>Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror is a third-person shooter stealth video game developed by Bend Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2.</p>\n<p>In this fifth installment to the Syphon Filter series, you play multiple characters, including Gabe Logan, all who are agents of Precision Strike, a government agency. In the game&#39;s single player story mode, standard Rambo tactics won&#39;t work. You must use stealth combined with state of the art weapons and melee combat to help uncover a deadly threat to global security, the Dark Mirror project. The game also allows you to replay all missions for special bonus material. The game&#39;s online multiplayer mode allows for four different games modes including team and free-for-all deathmatches and two different co-op games.</p>"
