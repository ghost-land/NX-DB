    "description": "<p>You can play as a rookie cop battling five different gangs spread throughout Capital City in Pursuit Force. The game features 30 cases for you to close, using 55 different vehicles and 25 types of weapons. Each gang has a unique boss and lieutenant with their own specialized vehicles and missions. Taking down gangs fills up your justice bar, which can be used to slow down time for key stunts, fill up your life, or repair your vehicle. The game features Hollywood-style chases and gunfights to keep the action going during missions.</p>"
