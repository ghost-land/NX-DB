    "description": "<p>GUN Showdown puts players in the role of Colton White, a vengeful gunslinger making his way through the untamed West of the late-1800s where the lines between good and evil are blurred and greed, lust and brutality were a way of life. The game features all of the action contained in the console versions, as well as all-new side missions, quick-play modes, multiplayer modes and gameplay features that are unique to the PSP system.</p>"
