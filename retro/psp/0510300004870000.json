    "description": "<p>In the future world, androids do almost everything that people do - they even start to think and feel. Although no one taught them this.</p>\n<p>The plot of &quot;Become Human&quot; is built around three characters, each with a separate storyline, but they eventually merge into a single picture.</p>\n<p>Connor is a police investigator and android. He has a simple task - to find androids, deviated from the path given by humans. He has a special vision, it allows him to see events as they happened. And the more information he collects, the higher his chances of acting correctly.</p>\n<p>Kara is an android-housekeeper which spontaneously develops self-consciousness. As a result, Kara assumes responsibility for the fate of the little girl whom she worked as a sitter for. She, along with the girl, escapes from the house as a result of a conflict with her father, the owner of Kara.</p>\n<p>Markus is a caretaker android. He also acquired self-consciousness and came to the idea that androids need freedom. He has the ability to grant androids free will and to calculate the consequences of some actions.</p>\n<p>The story develops depending on the decisions taken by the characters. Some decisions have to be made quickly. Sometimes a player can return to the moment of making a choice and replay the situation.</p>"
