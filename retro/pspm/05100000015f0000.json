    "description": "<p>Are you ready to become a Mighty Flip Champ? Take control of Alta and page flip through a series of action-packed mazes. The touch screen reflects a preview of the next chamber and shows Alta&#39;s projected destination within it. When it&#39;s time to flip, use Alta&#39;s Magical Warp Wand to replace her world with the next one. Will she land safely on solid ground or be crushed under it? By cycling endlessly through room after brain-busting room, you&#39;ll match wits with some of the most devious traps in puzzle/platforming history.</p>"
