    "description": "You grew up drawing little black stick men dying in horrible ways, but now they need your help! The Evil Blue Stick Minions are out in force, putting your stick men in danger. Rescue them using your futuristic troop transport copter and return them to base, but watch out for enemy weapons and traps! You could watch your stick men die hilariously horrible deaths, but then you wouldn\u2019t finish the level. What to do?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\u2022  30 action-packed, brain-busting levels: Each level is progressively more complex and dangerous than the last. Use your guns AND your brains to save all the stick men.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\u2022  Classic Stick Man Deaths: Will you save them all, or will they be burned alive, smashed, decapitated, blown up, electrocuted, dissolved by acid, or what?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPublished by TikGames.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
