    "description": "\"In the glade, there grew a tree.<br/>Merry, Merry king of the woods was he.<br/>Deep in his heart lived spirits, three.<br/>Dark secrets had this family.\"<br/><br/>In Where is my Heart? you play the story of a family of forest spirits. Their world gets broken up into fragments which you have to piece back together in your mind. Each of the three characters can transform into a magical creature along the way. The Rainbow Spirit allows you to rotate the world around and jump across space; the Bat King can see hidden platforms which only exist for him; the Antler Ancestor can jump on the stars. Help the three spirits find their home tree again!"
