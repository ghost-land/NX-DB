    "description": "<p>As bubbles grow, on-screen space gets more and more crowded. If the bubbles don\u00e2\u2122t expand enough to pop, all that room gets filled and the game ends. However, if enough like-colored bubbles are combined, they burst with points, bonuses and much more on-screen space to keep on playing.</p>"
