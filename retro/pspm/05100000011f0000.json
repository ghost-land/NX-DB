Sounds easy? Any mistake results in instant death, sending you back to the beginning of the level. With an awesome soundtrack synced to the game you\u2019ll quickly become addicted!<br/>\n<br/>\nTry and unlock medals throughout the game, including beating the game with no flags \u2014 all synced up with Steam Achievements \u2014 and use checkpoints to learn the levels with Practice Mode, allowing you to lay checkpoints along the way. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs well as five classic Impossible Game levels, this desktop version includes an EXCLUSIVE new Level Editor. Design your own near-impossible levels and send them over the internet to challenge the world!"
