Lot of insidious opponents, various weapons and realistic FLIR simulation.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBefore we start our mission we prepare flight plan, composing our route from predefined waypoints, where hostile forces are located.<br/>\r\nOur chopper will follow the route automatically, circling around each waypoint untill we finish with it and switch to the next one.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe task is to find enemies in the sight and destroy them all using air-to-ground missiles, 30-mm machinegun or IR-guided missiles. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nEnemies have camps and armories, tankers, trucks, off-road vehicles with heavy machineguns and infantry.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAs we progress through the game, our rank is increasing, and more weapons become available.
