    "description": "Use your laser to cut away the surfaces of a mysterious cube and free the energy within. Cutting longer lines and crossing multiple cube surfaces gives you bigger combos, but at far greater risk.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCan you brave this hazardous environment and complete all 20 levels? Old-school, highscore-chasing gameplay with a modern twist.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nDo you have what it takes to top the high score table and become number one?\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCubixx\u00a92010 Laughing Jackal Ltd.
