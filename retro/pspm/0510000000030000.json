    "description": "The makers of the award-winning 20Q\u00ae electronic toy bring its eerily accurate artificial intelligence to an App. If it doesn't say 20Q how can it read your mind?<br/><br/>You will be constantly amazed at 20Q's spooky ability to know what you're thinking. To play, think of something... anything... then answer a series of twenty questions. If it guesses within twenty questions, it wins. If not, you win! It's hours of fun as you try to stump 20Q. Play alone or use your iPad's AirPlay feature for group play. Can you stump the \"all knowing\" artificial intelligence of 20Q?<br/><br/>You can play in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish, and easily switch between languages.<br/><br/>Play 20Q! If you enjoy it, please consider leaving a warm review.
