    "description": "C. Kane is a satirical short form (2-3 hours) turn-based RPG that streamlines the genre to its basics; fighting monsters, talking to people, playing dress up. Dungeons are minimalist, graphics are monochrome. Random battles are no more, bosses are numerous. A Shark guides the way. An original hip hop soundtrack provides the beats.<br/><br/>For years, video games have been moving further and further away from \"toys\" and more towards their one true goal: To Be Art. With C. Kane, the dream of a thousand indie game designers has finally been fulfilled. Critics have asked when games would get their own Citizen Kane; we have answered their question. The answer is right now,<br/>in this game whose description you are reading.<br/><br/>Originally released September 2013, Kane is now all up in your Steam. <strong>This is an updated version of the original PC/Android release, containing new and revised content.</strong><br/><br/><strong>SECRET HINTS:</strong> To <strong>configure joysticks</strong>, press CTRL + J.<br/><br/><strong>Warning:</strong> Contains rude language, mild monochrome blood, and ugly monsters."
