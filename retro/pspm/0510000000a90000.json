    "description": "Du\u00e6l Invaders is a deliciously retro single-screen shootemup that lets you take control of two ships at once on the same PSP\u00ae (PlayStation\u00aePortable) system or DUALSHOCK\u00ae3 wireless controller<br/>\n<br/>\r\nIn the depths of deep space a human colony is threatened by the Du\u00e6l Invaders; the reddest and bluest badguys ever to threaten a human colony. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsing only the power of your red and blue player ships, a few power ups, and a simple-yet-innovative Aggro system called \u2018Skew\u2019, you must take on wave-after-wave of deadly enemies. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou score more points for shooting enemies of the same colour, but this also makes them VERY ANGRY! This simple rule is the key to staying alive and racking up massive high scores. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThrow in cool Dual (Co-op) and Duel (Versus) multiplayer modes that get your buddies involved and you\u2019ve got an awesome retro-shmup with the weirdest name on the Store! Good luck out there Commander! <br/>\n<br/>\r\nDu\u00e6l Invaders \u00a9 2011 Laughing Jackal Ltd. Laughing Jackal is a trademark of Laughing Jackal Ltd.
