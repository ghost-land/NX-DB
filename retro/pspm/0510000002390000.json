    "description": "In the far-flung future, particles of pure energy from a passing comet rain on a massive scrap heap, rousing five fearless robots from their deep slumber. Joining forces, our five mechanical heroes, Spad, Cosmo, Bruce, Helmut and Monk, build a spacecraft and outwit their guards as they escape from their iron prison. Their jailers' master, the vile Yagor, swears to hunt them down and rip them apart piece by piece.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nAboard the S-Pace, our five friends journey across a universe teeming with danger and scrap-iron mercenaries, intent on putting an end to Yagor's tyrannical reign. In an adventure jam-packed with mazes, mini-games and puzzles, you'll visit strange alien worlds and meet rancid creatures as you help our heroes fulfill their destiny.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWidget\u2019s Odyssey is a registered trademark of Frima Studio inc. \u00a9 2010 Frima Studio inc.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
