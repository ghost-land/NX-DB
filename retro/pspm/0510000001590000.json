    "description": "Jump into an exciting war between the Winged Crusade and the Landians! Mecho Wars is a turn-based strategy game where you command your troops to expand, control, and conquer your enemies. Strategically position your troops as each type has its strengths and weaknesses.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nIncluded in the game is a rich story-driven single player campaign, a special set of individual challenge maps, and remarkable multiplayer support with a single device.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe story of Mecho Wars details the rise of the Winged Crusade in the distant land of Divination Deserts. However, this is not your typical desert as there is plenty of water that separates land masses. Mecho Wars features a unique day-night cycle where water will freeze overnight allowing once inaccessible areas reachable in the early hours of the morning.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThe day-night cycle isn't used only in the single player campaign. Try facing off against a friend in multi-player. Be amused when you place your troops in the right spots for an overnight ambush!\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nCreat Studios, Inc. \u00a9 2011, Creat Studios, Inc.
