    "description": "<p>The year is 2067, and Earth is under attack from a race we have codenamed &#39;Vectoids.&#39; What you are holding in your hands is a computer simulation designed to train commanders in the art of defending from the ongoing threat they pose. The simulator comes compiled with 8 of the most common paths used by these enemies and the full range of attacking towers at our disposal.<br />\nEliminate each wave of Vectoids before they reach the end of the path by constructing towers. There are seven species of Vectoids, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Can you defeat the quick Yellow Sprinters? Are you equipped to deal with the armored Hard Greys? Only strategic placement of eleven types of towers, plus upgrades and boosts to enhance them, can ensure a victory against the Vectoid threat.<br />\nCan you survive all 50 waves?<br />\nVECTOR TD \u21222009 CANDYSTAND.COM, FUNTANK LLC ALL RIGHTS RESERVED<br />\nPurchase or use of this item is subject to the PlayStation\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service and User Agreement.
