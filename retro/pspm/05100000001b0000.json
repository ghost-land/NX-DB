    "description": "<p>Alien Havoc throws back to the classic 8-bit era, putting gamers in command of an alien who must pluck cows from farms, load them onto his spaceship, and bring them back to his planet. The farmers, however, won&#39;t let their cows go without a fight. Players must tackle wrapping level layouts, hide and sneak in the cover of tall grass, and throw veggies, rocks, or anything else they can at farmers to bring the livestock back to their space ship.</p>"
