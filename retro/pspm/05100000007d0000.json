    "description": "* \"Caterpillar\" \u2013 is the story of a caterpillar that goes on a journey to the place where it is destined to become a wonderful butterfly.<br/>* The caterpillar eats flowers. Along the way it encounters obstacles of red and purple bricks, which will disappear when the caterpillar eats the last red or purple flower in the level.<br/><br/><br/>* The caterpillar can crawl up walls and cling to them.<br/><br/><br/>* The caterpillar enemies are bees and worms.<br/>* The caterpillar can kill a bee by jumping on top of it and bouncing off.<br/>* Some worms come out of the ground and hide again. The caterpillar can only get past them when they are underground. Other worms simply block the caterpillar's path without hiding. The caterpillar needs to find an artifact, the Lightning spade, that will drive the worms underground forever.<br/><br/><br/>* The magic mushroom-faster helps the caterpillar to fly forward a certain distance.<br/>* The caterpillar can push off a half-sunken log to overcome the water barrier and find the right path.<br/>* The magic rays carry the caterpillar in any direction and over any obstacle from the beginning to the end of the ray."
