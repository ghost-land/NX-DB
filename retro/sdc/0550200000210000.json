    "description": "<p>Mars Matrix: Hyper Solid Shooting, or simply Mars Matrix (\u30de\u30fc\u30ba\u30de\u30c8\u30ea\u30c3\u30af\u30b9), is a vertical scrolling shooter arcade game developed by Takumi in 2000. The game was published by Capcom and run on their CPS-2 arcade system board. Mars Matrix was later ported to the Dreamcast video game console in 2001. The arcade version is notable for using a horizontally aligned monitor (much like Giga Wing), something that is considered rare for a vertical shooter.</p>"
