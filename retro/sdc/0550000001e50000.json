    "description": "<p>Asian Dynamite is an Arcade-only sequel to Dynamite Deka 2. While using the former&#39;s engine and sound effects, this game sticks closer to the original Dynamite Deka game having players rescue the President&#39;s kidnapped daughter. The main difference between Asian Dynamite and Dynamite Deka 2 are the new graphics, different characters and a redesigned power-up system that has players pick up suitcases and transform their characters into 3 different personas with their own fighting styles.</p>"
