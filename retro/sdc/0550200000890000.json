    "description": "<p>NBA Showtime is a basketball video game by Midway. A descendant of NBA Jam and NBA Hangtime, Showtime is modeled after the NBA presentations on NBC. The original arcade version features team rosters from the beginning of the 1998-99 NBA season, while the console versions feature team rosters that were accurate just prior to the 1999-2000 NBA season. A newer \"Gold\" version for arcades features another roster update from later in the 1999-2000 season. Showtime was also featured in a dual game cabinet along with NFL Blitz 2000. Midway followed up the game with the console exclusive NBA Hoopz.</p>\n<p>The home versions have Shaquille O'Neal as cover athlete.</p>"
