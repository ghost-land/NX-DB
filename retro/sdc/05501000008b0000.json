    "description": "<p>Coexist in a small space with your cat ... Cat. For every action you take, they take another, maybe. Maybe they'll stare at you, maybe they'll demand food. Maybe if you're lucky, you can pet the cat.<br/><br/>roommate makes use of simple commands that make up everyday tasks. 'make coffee', 'clean up', 'have nap' are examples of the types of actions that work with the game in its current form. At the moment commands are a tad limited, but I am planning to expand the idea into something bigger down the track.<br/><br/>roommate is a proof of concept made in a day to be\u00a0submitted to\u00a0LowRezJam 2019,\u00a0The Text-Based Adventure Game Jam, and\u00a0The Emotions and Feelings Jam. LowRez's 'text only' bonus theme, and the Text-Based Jam seemed like a perfect fit, while I wanted to create a sense of 'Togetherness' using the almost-silent company of a pet cat.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The font\u00a0Teeny Tiny Pixls is by\u00a0Chequered Ink Ltd.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy!</p>"
