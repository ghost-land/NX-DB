    "description": "Freud once said: \"Love and work, work and love...that's all there is.\"<br/>But what of the pain, the struggles that arise<br/>when we're forced to choose between our ambitions and love?<br/>In dealing with such conundrums, we\u2019ve all likely hurt those we hold dearest to us.<br/>For it's often in the darkness that we feel most safe.<br/>With Dad's Monster House, I wish to provide those kinds of heartrending memories a chance at redemption.<br/>I dedicate it to scientists, to my childhood dreams;<br/>to those I love, and to faded memories.<br/>I hope that within you'll find the greatest of answers, be they for your love, for science, or dreams.<br/><br/>[Gameplay]<br/>A sudden call in the deep of night has you return to a house you haven't visited for many a year. You must unravel one puzzle after another: to from within scenes intertwined with memories find clues and get to the bottom of your father's secret.<br/>The choice of whether to redeem or ultimately end this sad story lies in your hands.<br/><br/>[Features]<br/>Instead of going for bright and vivid colors, I have opted for a black-and-white art style. The fragmented narration, plentiful puzzles, and delicate sound designs create an immersive experience where you as the player get to truly feel the ups and downs of the protagonist's emotions. Continue to unravel the story as you collect more items..."
