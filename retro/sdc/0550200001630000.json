Clothed in charming 3D graphics these levels include massive bosses as well as alternative routes to explore, guaranteeing high replay value. <br/><br/><br/><br/>So, collect power-ups to build up your flashy projectiles and hurl them at the colorful enemies. Use powerful magic attacks to clear the screen with fireballs and lighting. Together with some trusty fairies you might stop the evil demon Tweed and help Cotton secure the elusive willow candy for herself. <br/><br/>This already magical experience is enhanced by fully localized anime cutscenes and a graphical overhaul, as well as numerous quality-of-life improvements. <br/><br/><h3>Features</h3><br/><ul><li><h3>Dedicated Retro Mode:</h3> replicating the original experience as closely as possible.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Enhanced controls:</h3> Revamped snap-back and lock-on features for a more engaging experience.<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Full Localization,</h3> Including the Anime Cutscenes!<br/><br/></li><li><h3>Graphic enhancements:</h3> particle effects, ambient occlusion, and more!</li></ul>"
