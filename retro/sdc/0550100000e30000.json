    "description": "<p>KISS Psycho Circus: The Nightmare Child is a demonic world of mystery and horror, where the player must battle the hideous freaks-of-nature spawned by the conception of an unborn evil- the Nightmare Child.</p>\n<p>The player begins as a mere mortal and progressively acquires the powers of The Elder, a supernatural being. The Elder, embodied by 4 alter egos: the Demon, the Starbearer, the Beast King, and the Celestial (based on the KISS characters), together can prevent the unraveling of the universe.</p>\n<p>The game is an intense first person shooter that is based on the rich world created by Todd McFarlane in his best-selling KISS, Psycho Circus comic books.</p>"
