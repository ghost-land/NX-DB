    "description": "<p>Volume is an indie stealth-action game developed by Mike Bithell Games.</p>\n<h3>Setting</h3>\n<p>The game is set in the same timeline as another game developed by Mike Bithell named Thomas Was Alone and takes place after the events of it. Volume&#39;s story is a modern take on the tale of Robin Hood. A thief named Robert steals a mysterious device called Volume that allows for the simulation of heists in order to attempt a military coup. Robert decides to stream the heists on the internet.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game is heavily inspired by the Metal Gear Solid game series. The game pays its homage to the Japanese video game series even in its camera work as it closely resembles the same top-down third-person view angle. </p>\n<p>There are 100 levels present in the game. The objective of each level is to unlock an exit point by collecting all the gems scattered across the level and get out of there as soon as possible without being spotted by the guards. The game offers a high rate of replayability as the performance of the player is evaluated and tracked on global leaderboards.</p>\n<p>The players can&#39;t kill the guards, yet they unlock a vast arsenal of various gadgets that can be used to distract the guards further into the game.</p>\n<p>The game comes bundled with a level editor which allows for the creation of your own missions. The players have to complete their levels before sharing them with the community.</p>"
