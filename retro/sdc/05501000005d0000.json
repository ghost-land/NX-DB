    "description": "<p>Heavy Metal: Geomatrix is a fully 3D arena fighting video game released in 2001 by both Sega and Capcom for the Sega NAOMI and Dreamcast, based upon the Heavy Metal license.</p>\n<p>Using similar perspective and control scheme to Capcom's Spawn: In the Demon's Hand, the game presents up to 4 players combats in large arenas in what is seen as a follow up to the basics of Capcom's Power Stone series, although more oriented to weapon fighting/shooting and a serious and dark cyberpunk tone because of the Heavy Metal universe setting. The game features a soundtrack of licensed music by artists such as Megadeth, Halford, W.A.S.P., Corrosion of Conformity and Dust to Dust. A soundtrack CD featuring songs used in the game as well as songs from other artists was released by Sanctuary Records to tie in with the game.</p>"
