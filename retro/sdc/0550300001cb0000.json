    "description": "<p>South Park is a first-person shooter video game based on the American animated comedy series of the same name. The game was developed by Iguana Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Nintendo 64 in 1998 for North America and in 1999 for Europe. It was later ported to Microsoft Windows in 1999 and released in North America only. The PlayStation port was developed by Appaloosa Interactive in 1999. A Game Boy Color version was in development, but it was eventually canceled by Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the creators, because they felt the game wouldn't fit in a console marketed towards kids. However, they did keep a few copies of the Game Boy Color version to commemorate what was originally started as the first South Park game. Despite the Nintendo 64's positive reception, the PC and PlayStation versions of South Park were very poorly received by critics.</p>"
