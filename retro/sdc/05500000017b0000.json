    "description": "<p>The protagonist spends her days cooped up inside, sinking countless hours into eroges. She would&#39;ve ended up bored to death eventually, if one day she wasn&#39;t teleported into a visual novel!<br />\nOf course, something like this isn&#39;t exactly a good situation for the young lady. Not only will you be privy to all of her shameful thoughts, you&#39;d also demand entertainment from her. Isn&#39;t that why you came to read this story?<br />\nSeems like she will now, at the very least, need to go outside to buy groceries... Because no matter where she goes, the plot will await her!Features:- totally original and definitely not cliche in any way love interests among which are girls named Yandere-chan and Dandere-chan;- more than two hundred choices that totally do matter, related to the heriones;- three different endings (and you definitely won&#39;t be forced to read all of them to understand the overarching plot better!);- this list doesn&#39;t contain any lies and in no way tries to subvert your expectations;- okay, fine, this is just your average yuri harem eroge without any plot whatsoever.Technical features:\u00d7 Graphics done in a whooping 640x480 screen resolution!\u00d7 Yume Nikki-like music: addicting less-than-ten-seconds loops included!\u00d7 Big breasts.<br />\nThis is a prototype version of the REFLEXIA VN, which can also be considered a remake.</p>"
