Larger cells, likewise, are seeking for smaller cells like you to absorb. Smaller cells move fast, larger cells are very slow! You can split yourself to increase your speed but this will increase the risk of being eaten. Finally, beware of the viruses!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMitosis allows you to:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- Four Game Modes: Free to Play, Random Team, Capture The Flag and Guilds War<br/>\r\n- Guild system with chatroom<br/>\r\n- Equipment system<br/>\r\n- Custom skins<br/>\r\n- Eat smaller cells to gain mass and become larger<br/>\r\n- Avoid larger cells because they can absorb you<br/>\r\n- Separate yourself into 2 cells to gain speed<br/>\r\n- Use viruses to hide yourself or hit others<br/>\r\n- Expel mass to decrease in size<br/>\r\n- Have a lot of fun!"
