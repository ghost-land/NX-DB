    "description": "<p>Talisman: Digital Edition is a video game adaptation of the fantasy board game of the same name. There have been four attempts to bring Talisman to digital media \u2014 Digital Edition is the fifth. The game uses the fourth version of the in-board-game rulebook and is officially approved by Games Workshop.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>There are several modes to the title: one may either play with AI opponents or invite a partner to play locally \u2014 no more than one device is required. The game also features online multiplayer with 2-6 players. The gameplay consists of dice rolling and making moves while doing the actions envisaged by the in-game cards or the tiles the player occupies. There are several characters to play with different stats and multiple cards in the deck including events, stuff, and characters.  Each player picks a character (there is a total of 12 in the board version and 74 in Steam one) and starts a journey from own tile. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The story behind the dice rolling centers around the Talisman world in which the powerful wizard once reigned with the help of his Crown of Command. At the end of his rule, the wizard decided to transfer the magical power and thus reign to the one finding Crown first. Not only would the successors need to reach the Crown, but also to eliminate the other challenger for the throne.</p>"
