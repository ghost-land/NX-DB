    "description": "That's Mahjong! is a Solitaire Mahjong game where the purpose is to match tiles of the same type, or any two season tiles.<br/>It aims to bring people into Mahjong and Solitaire together, no matter of which age group they belong to, or what are their hobbies, and it does that by having a multitude of themes.<br/>There's no time limit, but you can always run out of moves, so you will have to plan them carefully.<br/>Each pair awards you with 2 karma points.<br/><br/>Content (such as themes and levels) will keep being added to the game, but on release it will contain:<br/><br/>   - 24 themes<br/>   - 10 levels (tile arrangements)<br/>  Be careful! Some of these levels can be very challenging!<br/>   - Steam Achievements<br/>   - Steam Trading Cards (and of course, badges, emoticons and backgrounds!)<br/><br/>Some of the planned improvements are:<br/> <br/>   - Steam Leaderboards<br/>   - Steam Cloud Saving<br/><br/>So, sit back, relax, and get into the wonders of That's Mahjong!"
