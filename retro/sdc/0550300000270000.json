    "description": "<p>&quot;Sakura Taisen is a Strategy RPG that features a unique sim-based story system. An in-depth storyline exists, much like in any other RPG; however, the player&#39;s destiny in the game is not predetermined. Character interaction plays a major role. The player&#39;s interaction with the game dramatically influences the storyline and the ending, as the player nurtures relationships between certain characters, their performance in battle will also improve and the strength of their attacks soars. This means that the game&#39;s social elements are closely tied to the battle system. Sakura Wars carved out a whole new genre for itself, it&#39;s the first in gaming history to combine elements of dating simulation and strategy.&quot;</p>\n<p>&quot;Ichiro Ogami, having just been informed that he will be taking command of the secret corps known as the Imperial Assault Force (\u5e1d\u56fd\u83ef\u6483\u56e3 Teikoku Kagekidan), Flower Division (\u82b1\u7d44 Hanagumi), arrives in Teito (Imperial Capital Tokyo) and is taken to the Imperial Theater by Sakura Shinguji, who is herself new to the team. Ogami is greatly surprised to find that he has been posted to a theater, and doubly so when he&#39;s informed that he&#39;ll be filling the vital role of clipping tickets of patrons as they come in. Fortunately for his patience, it doesn&#39;t take long for the city to come under attack by evil forces, and he&#39;s quickly informed of his real role and given a quick course on operating the Koubu. Combat ensues, but he is able to push them back, with the aid of the Flower Division members.&quot;</p>\n<p>(Source: https://sakurataisen.fandom.com/wiki/Sakura_Wars_(Video_Game))</p>"
