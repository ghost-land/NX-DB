    "description": "<p>The story of Lesson: Hometown has to do about an investigator, mr. Papadopoulos, that knows the case in Lidoriki and that the investigator there, never came back. One day the phone rung and an old man asks him to investigate a similar case in Ptolemaida. Its about a school that was abandoned without reason but local people there say that something demonic happened there. Mr. Papadopoulos accepts it and goes there to find out what happened.
