A first re-release of the game was the Kanzenban (\u5b8c\u5168\u7248) edition for the Dreamcast which was later also the base for later ports of the game. It subsequently got ported onto the PS2 and the Gamecube, renamed to Code Veronica X and re-released again as HD version for the PS3/4 and XBOX 360.</p>\n<p>Claire Redfield, known from Resident Evil 2, searching for her lost brother, Chris, gets subsequently captured trying to infiltrate an Umbrella Research Facility, followed by being imprisoned and transported to a remote prison known as Rockford Island.<br />\nThere she must face the horrors she lived through in Raccoon City again as you guide her through a dark and eerie facility full of zombies and other horrors.<br />\nYou will solve many puzzles on your way in classic Resident Evil fashion and fight mutations other than zombies with various different tactics as you go from saveroom to saveroom and try not to die.</p>\n<p>As a bonus for completing the game you also unlock a fun battle mode.</p>"
