    "description": "<p><strong>When Dave Flimsy, a game developer for a large company, opens his mailbox in the morning, he finds a rather unpleasant message. It's the start of a horrible day.</strong></p>\n<p>Dave's Disk was made in two weeks for adventure game jam 2017. \u00a0#AdvJam2017</p>\n<p>--- Controls ---</p>\n<p>Keyboard: arrow keys and spacebar</p>\n<p>Gamepad: d-pad/left joystick and A-button</p>\n<p>Touch: hold one finger and drag to simulate arrow keys; touch with a second finger to simulate spacebar. Play the mobile version [here](https://quinten.github.io/daves-disk/).</p>\n<p>--- Tips ---</p>\n<p>You can climb by pressing the up key when you are over a ladder. You can climb up, but also down and left and right. When you are on a platform and there is a ladder right beneath you you must press down to start climbing. You can start climbing while you are in the middle of a jump by hitting the up key.</p>\n<p>You can also wall jump by hitting the jump button while you are sliding off a wall. When you fall from too high you will get killed, but wall jumping or starting to climb will cancel this effect.</p>\n<p>You can talk to friendly npc's by striking the down key.</p>\n<p>The agents and the boss will shock you when you hit them in a horizontal direction. To fight them you must jump on their heads.</p>\n<p>--- Credits ---</p>\n<p>Programming and pixel art:<br/>Quinten Clause</p>\n<p>Royalty free sounds by:<br/>sub-d, zittergeist, dopepoo, frankum, tuudurt and lizziam</p>\n<p>Special thanks to:<br/>Tine Pecceu</p>"
