    "description": "<p>Kirby&#39;s Dream Land 3 is the fifth platformer video game starring Kirby. Specifically, it is the third game under the Kirby&#39;s Dream Land name. Although the first two games were largely unrelated, Dream Land 3 features many similar characters to Dream Land 2. Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards was the sequel to this game.</p>\n<p>Kirby&#39;s Dream Land 3 was the last game published by Nintendo for the Super NES in North America. Problems with the game&#39;s PAL conversion prevented it from being released in Europe and Australia for many years; it was finally released for the Virtual Console in those regions in the form of an import from North America on July 24, 2009 for the Wii and on July 25, 2013 for the Wii U. The game was re-released on the Virtual Console in North America on January 5, 2009 for the Wii and on May 8, 2013 for the Wii U and in Japan on April 28, 2009 for the Wii and on May 8, 2013 for the Wii U. It was also included along with 5 other Kirby games in the Wii collection for Kirby&#39;s 20th anniversary, Kirby&#39;s Dream Collection.</p>"
