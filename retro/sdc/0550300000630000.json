    "description": "<p>Segagaga (\u30bb\u30ac\u30ac\u30ac, stylized SGGG) is a role-playing video game developed by Tez Okano of Sega and released solely in Japan for the Sega Dreamcast on March 29, 2001, towards the end of the console's lifespan.</p>\n<p>Segagaga's storyline makes tongue-in-cheek references to the commercially unsuccessful Dreamcast console - the player is recruited by Sega in a last-ditch effort to stop a rival company from taking over the console market. The game, interspersed with animated cut scenes, features numerous cameos by Sega characters and games, as well as a variety of gameplay styles.</p>"
