    "description": "<p>Ms. Pac-Man Maze Madness is a 3D, four-directional control (block-based) puzzle game starring Ms. Pac-Man. It released on the Sony PlayStation console in all regions, and was later released on the Nintendo 64 and Sega Dreamcast exclusively in North America. Unlike the previous 20th Anniversary Pac-Man World, the player must follow along designated paths. It was well received for its simple gameplay, staying true to the original 'Ms. Pac-Man' game, but its multiplayer mode was at times heavily criticized.</p>"
