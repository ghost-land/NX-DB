Key later released versions of Air without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation Vita. The story follows the life of Yukito Kunisaki, a traveling showman searching for the \"girl in the sky\". He arrives in a quiet, seaside town where he meets three girls, one of whom is the key to the end of his journey.</p>\n<p>The gameplay in Air follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the three female main characters by the player character. The game is divided into three segments\u2014Dream, Summer, and Air\u2014which serve as different phases in the overall story. The title of the game reflects the prominent themes of the air, skies, and use of wings throughout gameplay.
