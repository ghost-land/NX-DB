    "description": "<p>Surf Rocket Racers is a jet-ski racing game for the Dreamcast. As in most aquatic racers, success here depends on your ability to smoothly handle unpredictable waves and aggressive competition at the same time.</p>\n<p>There are several game modes to choose from. First up is the Championship. In this mode, you compete in a series of circuit races and accumulate points based on your finishing position. The racer with the most points at the end of the season wins. The other modes include a trick competition, a hazard and obstacle course, and a head-to-head 2-player mode.</p>"
