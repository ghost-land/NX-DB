    "description": "<p>Disc-O is a small student project made with Unity\u00a0that expands upon a game built at a local hackathon. The premise and mechanics are simple. Throw the disc with the R1/RB button. Let it cross the goal line and it will accrue points. To collect the points, catch the disc once it loops around or bounces back to you. You can only score off of discs that match your color. Intercept an opponent's disc to swap it to your color. Spin around to curve your throws. Quickly catch and release discs to maintain their momentum. Influence the\u00a0 soundtrack by outplaying your opponent, the winner's theme will dominate the musical score.\u00a0</p>\n<p>The game design and programming was handled by myself, Noah Johnson, and the music is by my good friend Isaac Hraga. You can hear more of his work on Soundcloud:\u00a0https://soundcloud.com/newagelame-o/tracks</p>\n<p>Supports Xbox and Playstation controllers as well as keyboard. At least one controller is required to play 2-Player. Otherwise, practice against a bot with a sliding difficulty control to improve your skills.</p>"
