    "description": "<p>According to the creators, the only game is a free simulator of an extreme sport, descending on a snowboard and skis.</p>\n<p>However, it is not completely clear in what sense this game is the only one - the only one in the genre of simulators of extreme winter sports or the only free in this genre.</p>\n<p>The game allows you to famously go through various trails for descending on snowboarding and skiing, without leaving the seat in front of the computer.</p>\n<p>The player has everything that a real snowboarder usually has - the slopes of the mountains, the full abundance of equipment, the beautiful (or not) weather and any amount of snow.</p>\n<p>Unlike the real world, in the game world you can design slopes at your own discretion.</p>\n<p>In the game there are unexpected finds, various types of competitions, including for groups of players. You can pass the tracks in different styles too.</p>\n<h3>Open world</h3>\n<p>The game world is open. This is not an analogue of the existing slope, but a huge alpine mountain created specifically for the game, Sialia. It has four slopes that you can explore, discovering towns, valleys, old ruins and much more.</p>\n<h3>Snow</h3>\n<p>The &quot;behavior&quot; of snow in the game reproduces all of its real physical characteristics on real mountain slopes. Just like in the game, the snow reacts in reality to skiing or snowboarding.<br />\nthat</p>"
