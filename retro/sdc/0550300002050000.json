    "description": "<p>A legend among motorcycle racers and the most memorable game of its kind to ever hit the PC market. Offering a superb blend of lightning-fast superbike racing and hairpin curve-infested motocross events, it became an instant classic. It&#39;s got a bunch of nifty features, like two driving models (arcade and simulation), vivid graphics that look pretty nice even today and a broad selection of motorcycles to choose from. But all these look pale when compared to this game&#39;s sheer fun factor, which will make you want to keep on playing and will burn itself into your memories forever.Absolutely unforgettable, fun-packed gameplay.<br />\nTwo realism levels and two completely different racing styles - motocross and superbike<br />\nTen diverse landscapes, from the base of a canyon to the top of the Great Wall</p>"
