    "description": "<p>Skies of Arcadia is a role-playing video game developed by Overworks for the Dreamcast and published by Sega in 2000. Players control Vyse, a young air pirate, and his friends as they attempt to stop the Valuan Empire from reviving ancient weapons with the potential to destroy the world.<br />\nThe game uses traditional Japanese role-playing game mechanics such as turn-based battles and experience point-based character progression, but puts greater focus on exploration, with the player flying an airship in 3D space. The development team included staff who had contributed to Panzer Dragoon Saga, Phantasy Star, Sonic the Hedgehog and Sakura Wars games.<br />\nSkies of Arcadia was one of the best reviewed games on the Dreamcast, but underperformed commercially. After Sega&#39;s exit from the hardware industry, it was ported to the Nintendo GameCube as Skies of Arcadia Legends in 2002.</p>"
