    "description": "<p>Agartha is an Adventure game, developed by No Cliche and published by Sega, which was cancelled before it was released.<br />\nA playable demo (from E3 2000) leaked onto the internet in 2018. It shows the main character, a bearded adventurer, exploring a snowbound Romanian village. The gameplay, though still in a rough formative state, is like a cross between Resident Evil and D2.</p>"
