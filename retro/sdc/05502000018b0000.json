    "description": "<p>Resident Evil 2 is the remake of the 1998 game of the same name. </p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The plot of the remake is identical to that of the original game. The story follows the survivors of a zombie virus outbreak in the fictional Raccoon City. There are two protagonists: Claire Redfield, a high school student, and Leon Kennedy, a policeman. They both search for the ways to escape the infested city. Companions, such as Ada Wong and Sherry, occasionally follow the protagonists. The characters eventually uncover the dark secrets of the Umbrella Corporation, which created the virus as a biological weapon, and fight its monsters, such as the Tyrant.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls either Leon or Claire from the third person view in a 3D environment. The two protagonists&#39; storylines are intertwined. The player can complete the scenario playing one of the protagonists, and then replay it from the other character&#39;s POV, with all his previous actions taken into account. The game combines puzzle solving with zombie fights. Both protagonists use firearms as their main weapon; however, ammo is scarce.</p>\n<h3>Changes from the original</h3>\n<p>Besides the updated graphics, the remake features a new camera and controls. In the original game, the controls were relative to the position of the player&#39;s character rather than the camera. The remake uses an over the shoulder camera, and the movements are relative to its angle. There&#39;s also no more loading screens, and the characters move between locations seamlessly.</p>"
