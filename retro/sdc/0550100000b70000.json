The theme is \"soft\" so we based the art style and gameplay around soft alpacas where you collect wool and love and take care of them.\u00a0</p>\r\nThis game is still in development and we would love to hear any feedback or ideas to improve gameplay in the future!\r\n\r\n\ud83c\udfa8Art &amp; Design:\r\n<p>https://hydriasensus.itch.io/<br/></p>\n<p>https://ryanpresto30gmailcom.itch.io/</p>\r\n\ud83c\udfb9Music &amp; SoundFX:\r\n<p>https://downtown-donny.itch.io/</p>\r\n\ud83d\udcbbProgramming:\r\n<p>https://seedsproutgames.itch.io/</p>"
