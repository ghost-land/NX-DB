    "description": "The Original Story of 8 Years With Your Beloved Daughter<strong>The Princess Maker series</strong><br/>Princess Maker introduced the concept of \u201craising your own daughter\u201d to the genre of life simulation games, combining stat-raising elements with an interesting, in-depth story as it follows the tale of a young girl adopted by a warrior and raised to become a lady. The phenomenal success of the first Princess Maker paved the way for Princess Maker 2, which was an international hit that opened the doors for several more acclaimed stories in the series.<br/><br/><strong>Fully refined visuals &amp; audio</strong><br/>Princess Maker Refine rejuvenates the classic title with a graphical makeover, improving on the classic charm of the original 16-bit color graphics with vivid, re-touched full color, supervised by the original creator, Takami Akai. Voice acting has also been added, bringing an extra layer of immersion to the game and helping you connect more with your daughter.<br/><br/><strong>Raise your daughter with love</strong><br/>You are the hero who saved a kingdom besieged by evil and on the verge of total ruin.
