    "description": "A curse has befallen the Crescent Isle and it's up to you to save them. Luckily the curse has transformed your people into helpful monsters such as drills, blobs, icicles, and gravity flipping...things. With your monster subjects in hand you'll have to drill through rocks, maneuver through spiky terrain, freeze water to pass over the sea, and restore your kingdom to its former glory. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nKey features: <br/>\r\nStory Mode <br/>\r\nSpeedrun Mode <br/>\r\nBoss Rush Mode <br/>\r\nSound Test <br/>\r\nLocal Co-op <br/>\r\nUpdated graphics and sound (from the Xbox 360 version) <br/>\r\nUpdated game engine with improved physics (ish)<br/>\n<br/>\r\n--Credits-- <br/>\r\nCOVER ART: TEMMIE CHANG -https://twitter.com/tuyoki <br/>\r\nCOMPOSER: DANIEL DAVIS - https://twitter.com/an0va <br/>\r\nARRANGER: STEVE LAKAWICZ -https://twitter.com/a_p_0_c <br/>\r\nGRAPHICS: MICHAEL LAMBERT -https://twitter.com/Jakten <br/>\r\nDESIGN &amp; PROGRAMMING: ADAM MOWERY - https://twitter.com/1amowery"
