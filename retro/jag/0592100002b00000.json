    "description": "<p>Fever Pitch Soccer (in North America, Head-On Soccer) is a soccer video game developed by US Gold. It was released in 1995 for the Super NES, Genesis, and Atari Jaguar consoles. It is a slapstick game in which the player tends to have to lean towards \"dirty\" play, and special player abilities include the ability to dive in an attempt to win a free-kick or penalty. There are two gameplay modes: tournament and exhibition. A password is given out following the successful completion of each game in the tournament so that play can be resumed at a later point.</p>\n<p>In Germany, the Super NES game was released under the title Mario Basler: Jetzt geht\u2019s Los!.</p>"
