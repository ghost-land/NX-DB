    "description": "<p>Tempest 2000 is an intergalactic shooting gallery in hell. You&#39;ve never had so much coming at you so fast in so many colors. Named the &quot;Best of Show&quot; at CES, you&#39;ll explore 100 enemy-packed galaxies, experience outrageous Melt-O-Vision graphics and powerful 3D polygons, and be driven to a frenzy by an original techno-rave score. There&#39;s even an optional two-player mode. Don&#39;t forget, Tempest 2000 can only be played on the powerful Jaguar 64-Bit system by Atari. With all this action, no other system could handle it. Yes, you have a chance to survive. Yes, it&#39;s a slim one.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Flippers. Don&#39;t let the innocent name fool you. Once they flip onto you, they&#39;ll suck you down pronto.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Pulsars. The electric eels of the cosmos. They electrify corridors. If you&#39;re on the corridor, you fry.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Fuseballs. The scumballs of the universe. If a Fuseball touches your blaster, you&#39;re history.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Demon Heads. Intergalactic bad-asses. When you shoot one, its horns live on. Nasty little trick.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>UFOs. Now you&#39;re surrounded. UFOs fly above the web and you&#39;ve got to get above them. Good luck.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Warp Bonus Round. Too weird to describe. Just get there and zone out for some serious points.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>"
