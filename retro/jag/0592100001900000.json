    "description": "Don't wait till you see the whites of their eyes...<br/>\nDon't kid yourself it will be over by Christmas...<br/>\nDon't try to shut out the screams...<br/>\nAnd don't forget to wash your hands afterwards...\n<br/><br/>\nFrom a queue of some 360 \"eager\" conscripts waiting to go to war, a team of up to six will \"volunteer\" for each new mission. Encourage your soldiers to shoot anything that moves, throw grenades, fire bazookas, drive tanks, fly choppers, split up and do their own thing... and die...\nGuide your no-hoper's troop straight through deadly missions.\nAnd if you lose some of them? There's more where that came from...Action-driven, fast-paced classic arcade gameplay\nA mix of tactical insight and fast reflexes required, a good micro would be a plus\nWar has never been so much fun!"
