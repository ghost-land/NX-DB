    "description": "<strong>Kith</strong> is a planetoid covered in fractures. Between these fractures are plateaus. On these plateaus, there is life. Deep in the cracks though, there is a dark and mysterious mist. Word is, nobody has ever been down there, and nobody knows if it has a bottom. Most don't think about it too much though. There's stuff to do.<br/><br/>Welcome to this regular mini-adventure series with a focus on character and world building. In small chunks you will get to know the people and places of this world, and hopefully be charmed by their... charm. Kith episodes will always be tiny, but always free.<br/><br/><strong>If you would like to support the continuation of these mini adventures, please consider grabbing the DLC.</strong> <br/><br/>Music by Ben Burnes, aka Abstraction."
