    "description": "<strong>Proto Raider</strong> is a single screen auto-running puzzle platformer covered in ASCII beauty.<br/><br/>There's so much to do when exploring this colorful and imaginative world. Grab your scuba gear and go for a dive, chill out and ride some waterfalls, or maybe go sailing! Be careful though, as with all wondrous actions come with consequences. You just might drown, get poisoned, burnt to ashes, or turn into stone! <br/><br/>In order to complete quests and collect treasures, you'll need agility, weapons, and special items that give you various superpowers. Most of all, you'll need courage my friend. Fearsome monsters and bosses lurk in this world... and YOU will have to defeat them, grab the key, and go!"
