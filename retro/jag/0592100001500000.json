    "description": "<p>So, you like chipped teeth more than chip shots. Alley gangs more than alley-oops. And in your most honest moments, you gotta admit that football is just a little boring.<br />\nWake up and smell the blood. Spectrum HoloByte proudly throws the first punch in the Brutal Sports Series, a new line of futuristic sports simulations created by Millenium. Introducing Beastball, a rowdy ride through the football of tomorrow. Eight teams of man-made mutants, each with their own skills, duke it out for the league title and the Beastball Championship. Pit your favorite team against a human or computer opponent in the arena. And when the door slams shut, heads are gonna roll. Literally.<br />\nIt&#39;s 2089, and a strip of dirt in a pit is home to the game, a fast sport guaranteed to churn the blood. Superb animations and sounds capture all the hits of slambang comedy. And they&#39;re really slambang. Stomp the other guy? You catch a cannonball. Try to run out of bounds? You suck wall. Leap high for a kick and you get skewered. The object: put the ball in the goal. How you do it is up to you.<br />\nBeastball. Football with a new set of rules. No rules.<br />\n<em> One or two players.<br />\n</em> League or Championship play.<br />\n<em> Special weapons and skills for each team.<br />\n</em> Combatant regenerator after each match.<br />\n* Laughs. Blood.</p>"
