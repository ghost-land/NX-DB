    "description": "<p>In Dino Evolution you play as dinosaur starting 252 mio. years ago. You need to eat and drink as well as \u00a0dodge or fight enemy dinosaurs to survive and grow stronger.</p>\n<p>Can you get your way all through the three mesozoic eras?</p>\n<p>For controls you only need WASD (and a mouse to click on buttons).</p>\n<p>This game is a submission to 7DRL.</p><p>I tried to apply basic concepts for my first roguelike, such as random level generation, ressource management, turn-based gameplay and permanent death.</p>\n<p>Feedback is much appreciated!</p>"
