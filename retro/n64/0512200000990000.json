    "description": "<p>Harvest Moon 64, released in Japan as Bokuj\u014d Monogatari 2 (\u7267\u5834\u7269\u8a9e2), is a farm simulation video game developed by Victor Interactive Software and published by Natsume for the Nintendo 64 video game console, and the third game in the Story of Seasons series (following Harvest Moon GB). It was first released in Japan on February 5, 1999, and was later released in North America on December 22, 1999.<br />\nNatsume initially stated bringing it to Wii U Virtual Console was not possible due to unknown technical issues, despite the Wii proving the task to be possible through homebrew emulation. However, in celebration of the series&#39; twentieth anniversary, the game abruptly saw release on the Wii U Virtual Console on February 23, 2017. This also marked the game&#39;s debut in the PAL regions (the original had been cancelled due to time constraints), as well as the game&#39;s first official re-release (as well as the first time digital) in nearly two decades.</p>"
