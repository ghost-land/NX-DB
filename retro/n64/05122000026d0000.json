    "description": "<p>Virtual Chess 64 is a chess simulation game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 1998. The game features no true \"completion\" in the form of a goal or a score, so one could theoretically play an endless number of matches. When a piece is captured, a short animated cutscene plays back depicting the battle, as in 1988's Battle Chess.</p>"
