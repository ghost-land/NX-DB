    "description": "<p>Purchase this PS one\u00ae Classic and play it on both your PS3\u2122 and PSP\u00ae systems!<br />\nThis ain&#39;t no dragstrip. It&#39;s the place where cars come to die. You&#39;re on a mission to bash, smash and crash into the other guy until his auto (or yours) gives up the ghost. Play against the fiendish computer opponents. The array of tracks and race styles will keep you coming back for more!<br />\nTransferring to a PSP\u00ae system from your PS3\u2122 system:<br />\nYou must be signed into the PLAYSTATION\u00aeNetwork account that originally purchased the game. You must have at least 66 MB free on your Memory Stick Duo\u2122. Connect your PSP\u00ae system to your PS3\u2122 system with a USB cable and switch your PSP\u00ae system to USB Mode. Highlight the game on the PS3\u2122 XMB, press the \u0394 button and select Copy.<br />\nPC Store Customers:<br />\nLog into your PLAYSTATION\u00aeNetwork account that you originally used to purchased the game.  Then, download the game from your \u201cDownload List\u201d in the PlayStation Store onto your PS3\u2122 system.<br />\nThis title has been converted from the original PlayStation\u00ae disc to the PSP\u00ae(PlayStation\u00aePortable) and the PS3\u2122 systems. Consequently, there may be times where the title plays differently from the PlayStation\u00ae disc version, or where some features do not function properly.  This version does not support PlayStation\u00ae peripherals (controller, memory card, multitap, etc.), therefore functionality such as multiplayer, versus, and co-op modes are not available.<br />\nPurchase indicates acceptance of the PLAYSTATION\u00aeNetwork Terms of Service/User Agreement and this item&#39;s use restrictions.  If you do not wish to accept all those terms, do not purchase this item.
