    "description": "<p>SM64 romhack by Kaze Emanuar.</p>\n<p>&quot;This Game has 130 stars, 12 powerups, a completely new soundtrack, many new bosses and a large variety of completely new levels. Over 4000 hours of work finally come together. <br />\nIt is really difficult for Nintendo standards and i recommend you to not try to get every last thing, unless you are very determined to beat the game 100% and have played through SM64 before.</p>\n<p>Download:<br />\nhttps://mega.nz/#!GCIziaqJ!SzBkng0w0ktovmZotXgr6X_ATkN0NX9uqtfX5Fy6uTQ</p>\n<p>If you want to support my work and want to see more romhacks, you can subscribe to this channel or donate to my paypal:<br />\nhttps://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=MQEC7GJXU2YPS<br />\n&quot;</p>"
