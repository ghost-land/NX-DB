    "description": "<p>GT 64: Championship Edition is a racing video game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in Japan as City Tour GrandPrix: Zen Nihon GT Senshuken with two new Japanese exclusive tracks in 1998. It was an official licensed game to All-Japan GT Championship, featuring cars and drivers of the 1997 All Japan Grand Touring Car Championship. GT and Grand Tour are references to long distance traveling such as in the traditional version of the Grand Tour. It was one of the last games to be published by Ocean Software after the company was bought out in 1996.</p>\n<p>Despite the name, it is otherwise unrelated to Kaneko's Hyper Battle Game: Zen Nihon GT Senshuken. Instead, it is related to Imagineer's GT Racing.</p>"
