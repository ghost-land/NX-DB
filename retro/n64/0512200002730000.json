The game was only released in Japan, and is the Japanese counterpart to WCW vs nWo: World Tour. The game features wrestlers from World Championship Wrestling, but also includes generic renditions of wrestlers from major Japanese promotions such as New Japan Pro Wrestling and All Japan Pro Wrestling, a feature that would continue following the release of the sequel Virtual Pro Wrestling 2.
