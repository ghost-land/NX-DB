    "description": "<p>Iggy&#39;s Reckin&#39; Balls is a video game that was developed exclusively for the Nintendo 64 console by Iguana Entertainment and published by Acclaim Entertainment in August 1998. It involves a set of ball characters with faces and unique personalities that race around a series of vertical obstacle courses in order to win medals. The characters use grappling hooks to climb to other platforms and attack other players. Power-ups are scattered throughout the 100 courses, which equip the players with temporary special abilities. Up to four players can participate. Modes of play include Arcade, Mix-up, Time Trial and Battle. There are a total of eight characters to choose from immediately, with an additional nine hidden characters that can be unlocked later. The game is named after Iggy, who is the main character. Iggy represents the developer&#39;s mascot, an iguana.</p>"
