    "description": "<p>Mario Golf (\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30b4\u30eb\u30d564, Mario Gorufu Rokuj\u016byon, Mario Golf 64) is a sports game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 in 1999. In the game, Mario, his friends, and his enemies play golf on a variety of Mario-themed courses. It is the second game in the Mario Golf series (though the first to carry that name). Its tagline was &quot;Tee up with Mario and his friends!&quot;<br />\nA portable version of this game for Game Boy Color (known as Mario Golf GB (\u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30b4\u30eb\u30d5\uff27\uff22) in Japan) was also developed by Camelot Software Planning. Unlike the console version, it includes role-playing video game elements.</p>"
