    "description": "<p>Zoor: Maj\u016b Tsukai Densetsu (\u30ba\u30fc\u30eb \u9b54\u7363\u4f7f\u3044\u4f1d\u8aac) is a role-playing video game for the Nintendo 64. It was released in 1999 in Japan only.<br />\nThe gameplay is similar to Pok\u00e9mon in that it shares the same concept of catching monsters. Your character finds a monster and raises it to battle evil. The towns are presented in a top down view. The houses, inns, bars, dungeons and shops are fixed points you can put a cursor over. The battle system features a bar of musical notes that the player uses to command the monsters. You can carry up to four monsters at a time.</p>"
