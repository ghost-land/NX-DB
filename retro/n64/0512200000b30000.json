    "description": "<p>International Superstar Soccer 64 (officially abbreviated as ISS 64, originally released in Japan as Jikkyou J.League Perfect Striker and then later adapted as Jikkyou World Soccer 3) is a football video game developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Osaka in the International Superstar Soccer series by Konami and released for the Nintendo 64 that is essentially a Nintendo 64 version of International Superstar Soccer Pro. The game on the whole is similar to the PlayStation version (including the same player names, with the exception of Japan, England and a handful of USA players) but with some teams having a more inaccurate home or away kit (USA, for example, uses their 1994 World Cup Adidas \"stripes\" kit as home kit and their then-current Nike home kit as away kit). As for its team lineup, it follows more closely the Super NES version of International Superstar Soccer Deluxe, only with South Africa replacing Morocco.</p>"
