    "description": "<p>Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero is a 1997 action-adventure game of the fighting game series Mortal Kombat. It is the first Mortal Kombat game to feature side-scrolling gameplay. It was released for the PlayStation and Nintendo 64. Mythologies is a prequel set prior to the events of the tournament in the original Mortal Kombat. The storyline centers on the warrior, Sub-Zero. In the story he is asked to find an amulet by the sorcerer Quan Chi. The player controls Sub-Zero in multiple stages as he faces multiple enemies trying to eliminate him.<br />\nThe PlayStation version features live-action cutscenes, but the Nintendo 64 version of the game replaced the live-action cutscenes with still images of such, due to limited storage space on the cartridge. The game has been panned by video game publications due to a poor transition from fighting games to an action-adventure genre and has been labeled as the 2nd worst Mortal Kombat game next to Mortal Kombat: Special Forces.</p>"
