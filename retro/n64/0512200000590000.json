    "description": "<p>Duke Nukem: Zero Hour is a third-person shooter video game in the Duke Nukem series, developed by Eurocom Developments for the Nintendo 64. The game uses a relatively large 32-megabyte cartridge and can also use the Expansion Pak to allow for better graphics but slows down the frame rate. It has a 4 player split-screen multiplayer mode that uses a first-person view.</p>\n<p>The plot revolves around time-traveling aliens attempting to alter the course of history and eliminate Duke&#39;s ancestors. Locations, weapons, items, and clothing are relevant to the time period Duke is in.<br />\nThe game has an opening intro that explains the concept of the plot. The game also has many mature plot elements. In one stage, Duke time-travels to the Victorian Era and finds the still-fresh murder scene of Mary Jane Kelly. She had been slain at her residence of 13 Miller&#39;s Court on November 9, 1888 by Jack the Ripper. In another, Duke must travel through a New York devastated by atomic warfare.</p>"
