    "description": "<p>Wave Race 64 is a racing video game developed by Nintendo EAD and published by Nintendo. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and is a follow-up to the 1992 Game Boy title Wave Race. Most of the game involves the player racing on a Jet Ski on a variety of courses while successfully manoeuvring the vehicle around various buoys. A multiplayer mode where two players can compete against each other on a chosen course is also included. The game supports the Controller Pak, which allows players to transfer saved data from one game cartridge to another.<br />\nOriginally referred to as &quot;F-Zero on water&quot;, the game was intended to feature high-speed boats with transforming capabilities. However, these were ultimately replaced with Jet Skis as producer Shigeru Miyamoto felt that the game would not be differentiated enough from other titles on other systems. Wave Race 64 received critical acclaim from critics, who praised the game&#39;s satisfying controls and dynamic watery environments. The game is credited for helping Nintendo effectively make its paradigmatic leap from the 16-bit 2D graphics of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System to the Nintendo 64&#39;s 3D capabilities. It was re-released for the Wii and Wii U&#39;s Virtual Console in 2007 and 2016, respectively. A sequel, Wave Race: Blue Storm, was released in 2001.</p>"
