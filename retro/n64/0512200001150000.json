Help the two brothers<br />\nclear stages by collecting coins and avoiding getting hit by enemies.<br />\nCrabs, turtles, and fighter flies must be cleared out by jumping<br />\nunderneath the platform they step on and then kicking them away. But<br />\nbeware! Just when you think you got rid of them, they come back for<br />\nmore! Play alone or with a friend. Either way, this is one underground<br />\nclassic you will want to play time and time again.<br />\nThis game is only playable in 2D.This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
