    "description": "<p>Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr. is an arcade-style baseball video game produced by Nintendo and developed by Angel Studios for the Nintendo 64 platform. The game is follow-up to Nintendo&#39;s previous title featuring Griffey, Ken Griffey Jr.&#39;s Winning Run. It was released on May 31, 1998, and allows players to choose any contemporary Major League Baseball franchise and play through an exhibition, a complete season, or a World Series. Players can also choose any player from any team to compete in a Home Run Derby. The player can also select up to four individuals to play as in Home Run Derby. The game also featured all 30 MLB team&#39;s stadiums. The game was seen as a faster, more arcade-like baseball game compared to its rivaling product, the more realistic baseball simulation All-Star Baseball &#39;99. Nintendo released a sequel the following year, called Ken Griffey Jr.&#39;s Slugfest.</p>"
