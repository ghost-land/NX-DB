    "description": "<p>Fighters Destiny, known in Japan as Fighting Cup (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30c6\u30a3\u30f3\u30b0\u30ab\u30c3\u30d7 Faitingu Kappu) is a 1998 video game developed by Genki and published by Imagineer for the Nintendo 64. It closely models the 3D fighting game standard set by Sega's Virtua Fighter, but integrates a unique point scoring system. The game's generic characters and unoriginal presentation have been panned by critics, but reviewers praise its point system and consider it to be one of the best fighting games on the Nintendo 64. It was followed by a 2000 sequel Fighter Destiny 2.</p>"
