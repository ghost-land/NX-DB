    "description": "<p>Virtual Pro Wrestling 2: \u014cd\u014d Keish\u014d (\u30d0\u30fc\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30fb\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b92 \u301c\u738b\u9053\u7d99\u627f\u301c) is a professional wrestling video game released in 2000 for the Nintendo 64 game console. The game was only released in Japan and is the sequel to 1997&#39;s Virtual Pro Wrestling 64. The subtitle, \u014cd\u014d Keish\u014d, translates to English as Royal Road Succession, which is also the name of the game&#39;s single player mode.<br />\nThe game features the same engine as WWF WrestleMania 2000 but the two titles otherwise differ considerably and feature entirely different rosters. WrestleMania 2000 was released in Japan as well, unlike previous AKI-developed WCW titles.</p>"
