This &quot;director&#39;s cut&quot; contains many extras added to the original Clay Fighter 63 1/3 game. You might lose lives, you might lose limbs, but don&#39;t lose your sense of humor! 12 eccentric fighters plus 4 additional clay combatants only found in this version. More snide remarks and barbed wit will have you crying from laughing so hard! Original characters get additional attacks for an all-new experience. Enhanced camera angle stays put to see more details in the environment and improve fight control!</p>"
