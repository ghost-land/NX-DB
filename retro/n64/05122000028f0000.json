    "description": "<p>The first blast wiped out your space center, and in just three hours, the high-tech weapons satellite is going to strike again--unless you stop it. You are Jean-Luc Couger, a special operative for the government&#39;s Strategic Covert Actions Team. As the terrorists count down to a second attack, you must duck, sneak, and crawl through enemy-infested environments. And when the situation calls for a more aggressive approach, you&#39;ll have a wide variety of weapons to choose from.</p>"
