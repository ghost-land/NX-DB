Great if you need to burn just a minute or two!\"<br/><br/>rminerick: \"Ad\u00addic\u00adtive and easy to pick up when you have a few idle min\u00adutes.\"<br/><br/><br/>---<br/><br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Dodge objects to stay alive. Just tap to move to a new position.<br/><br/>A new object is generated every few seconds when staying in place. But every time you move, a new one is created immediately! Moving creates a black hole, absorbing everything it touches.<br/><br/>Time your movement wisely!<br/><br/>Collect shield items to gain extra protection. When you get hit, your shield gets destroyed in an explosion. This explosion will destroy every object it reaches.<br/><br/>Maintain control over the board by timing your movement and using your shields.<br/><br/>Have fun!"
