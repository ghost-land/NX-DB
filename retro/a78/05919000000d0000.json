    "description": "<p>Basketbrawl is a video game released for the Atari 7800 in 1990, then later for the Atari Lynx in 1992. It is a sports simulation which allows hitting and fighting with other players. The name is a portmanteau of the words basketball and brawl. Basketbrawl is similar to the 1989 Midway arcade game Arch Rivals which had the tagline \"A basket brawl!\"</p>\n<p>Atari released another sports/fighting combo for the Atari 7800 in 1990 as Ninja Golf. Both were in the final 11 games published by Atari for that system in 1990-91 before dropping support.</p>"
