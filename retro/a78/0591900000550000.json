    "description": "<h2>&#39;Scrapyard Dog&#39; is a 1990 side-scrolling platformer game for the Atari 7800 developed by BlueSky Software.</h2>\n<p>As the player assumes the role of the big-nosed protagonist, it entails the adventures of Louie as he bounds, leaps, and barges his way through various worlds and enemies to save his pet dog, Scraps, who has been kidnapped by the unrighteous &quot;Mr. Big&quot;.</p>\n<p>Being bestowed with a not-so-usual world as its rural setting, Louie dives into scrapyard dumpsters that lead into mini-dimensions- some having puzzles that reward bonus points, shopkeepers promising power-ups in exchange for a good deal, or even hidden items that can be saved for later.</p>\n<p>A remake was made in 1991 for the Atari Lynx, which extended upon the graphics and overall design, whilst also retaining the same spark of its predecessor&#39;s gameplay mechanics.</p>"
