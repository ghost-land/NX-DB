    "description": "<p>Armed with an array of Air-Interceptor Missiles, and a 20mm &quot;Vulcan&quot; cannon, you fly a series of blue-water operations while engaging in head-to-head combat with MIG 29s, MIG 24s, and enemy targets. Numerous cockpit computer displays help you splash each enemy bogey with extreme precision, and when you&#39;ve completed your sortie, attempt a heart-pounding first-person carrier landing that will challenge even the most experienced naval aviator. Fly alone or link up for some gut-wrenching head-to-head four player competition as you battle for supremacy of the skies.</p>"
