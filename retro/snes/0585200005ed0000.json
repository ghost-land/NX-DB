    "description": "<p>Ultima VII: The Black Gate is the seventh installment of the Ultima series of role-playing video games, released on April 16, 1992. In it the player returns as The Avatar, a would-be paragon of moral virtue who faces down many dangers and deceptions in order to cleanse the medieval fantasy world of Britannia of assorted schemes and conspiracies, monster infestations, the undermining of crown authority, and other machinations by hostile and cunning opponents.</p>\n<p>The Black Gate was critically acclaimed and commercially successful, being widely lauded as a high point in the series and as one of the best RPGs ever created. In an interview with GameSpot, Richard Garriott stated that Ultima VII \"was the most masterfully executed of the Ultima series.\" He has also often stated that the game was, along with Ultima IV, his own favorite installment overall.</p>"
