    "description": "<p>Super Batter Up (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30b9\u30bf, Super Famista) is a baseball video game with both a one- and two-player mode plus a league mode.</p>\n<p>The North American release has an official license from the Major League Baseball Players Association and features the names of actual professional baseball players. However, it does not have a license from Major League Baseball, so no actual team names are used, only their respective cities. While the all-star mode in the Japanese version of the game closely mimics the Nippon Professional Baseball All-Star Series, the North American version of the game emulates the MLB All-Star Game. An intrasquad mode (found only in the Japanese version) allows players on the same time to face off against each other. The only limitations are that there are only five pitchers on each team, players cannot be changed, and uniforms are limited to red and white colors.</p>"
