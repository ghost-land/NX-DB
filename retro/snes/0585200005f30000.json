    "description": "<p>Umihara Kawase (\u6d77\u8179\u5ddd\u80cc) is a series of platform games, starring a young Japanese school girl named Kawase Umihara (\u6d77\u8179 \u5ddd\u80cc Umihara Kawase), who has somehow become lost in a world of surreal salt-water and fresh-water creatures. She wears a bright pink rucksack. The Umihara Kawase games&#39; main distinction are their tranquil fish and bird infested worlds and the rope physics, which defines the gameplay.<br />\nThe name is written as four kanji characters: umi, hara, kawa, se meaning sea, belly, river, back. This is an extraction from a Japanese kitchen idiom &quot;Sea fish are fat in the belly; river fish are fat in the back.&quot;.<br />\nThe protagonist was first seen in the eponymous Super Famicom release of 1994 and later the sequel and re-release of Umihara Kawase Shun for the PlayStation in 1997 and 2000.</p>"
