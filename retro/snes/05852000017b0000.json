    "description": "<p>Final Fantasy VI first debuted in 1994 as the sixth installment in the iconic Final Fantasy series. Innovations included the ability to play all the main characters as the game&#39;s protagonist, and to this day, its epic story intertwining each of their fates is still highly rated and wildly popular.<br />\nWith plenty of abilities available and the magicite system for controlling spells/summoning, players can develop their characters any way they want. This was also the first Final Fantasy game to include the Ultima Weapon, the most powerful sword of all and a recurring item in subsequent titles within the series.</p>\n<p>The War of Magi left little but ashes and misery in its wake. Even magic itself had vanished from the world. Now, a thousand years later, humankind has remade the world through the power of iron, gunpowder, steam engines, and other machines and technologies.</p>\n<p>But there is one who possesses the lost power of magic--a young girl name Terra whom the evil Empire has kept enslaved in an effort to harness her power as weapon. This leads to a fateful meeting between Terra and a young man named Locke. Their harrowing escape from the Empire&#39;s clutches sets in motion a series of events that touches countless lives and leads to one inevitable conclusion.</p>"
