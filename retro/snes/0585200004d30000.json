    "description": "<p>Dive headfirst into the action with your famously hard head in the first<br />\ninstallment of the Bonk series on the Super NES. This time, Bonk has<br />\nbeen caught in King Drool&#39;s trap and hurled into darkness. To find his<br />\nway back to prehistoric times, he must embark on an adventure through<br />\nstreets, caves and eventually outer space!</p>\n<p>Progress through the stages controlling Bonk, but watch out for enemies<br />\nblocking your path. Eat meat to transform Bonk and perform even more<br />\npowerful attacks! Many challenges lie in Bonk&#39;s path. In addition to<br />\nBonk&#39;s spin and climb moves, you can use items like candy, which changes<br />\nBonk&#39;s size, to overcome these obstacles!<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
