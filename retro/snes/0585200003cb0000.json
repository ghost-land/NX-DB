    "description": "<p>Gouketsuji Ichizoku (\u8c6a\u8840\u5bfa\u4e00\u65cf, G\u014dketsuji Family) is a Action/Fighting video game published by Atlus released on October 14th, 1994 for the SNES.<br />\nThe series is known for its absurdist humor. Unique to the series was the introduction of the transformation feature: several of the characters can change their appearance and fighting style by simply executing certain moves (usually a throwing move), though this has not been featured in every entry in the series. Other features include the ability for every character to perform a double jump, run, and attack while running.</p>"
