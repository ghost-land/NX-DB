    "description": "<p>Super Ninja Boy (Super Chinese World in Japan) is an action role-playing game released for the Super NES. It features random encounters with side-scrolling battles, although some boss battles are fought with a traditional menu-based system. There are also a few platforming sections.<br />\nIn single player mode, the main character is Jack. The game can be switched between single player and multiplayer at will, with the second player controlling Ryu. Jack and Ryu share statistics, so one character never overpowers the other.<br />\nSuper Ninja Boy features a password system to record progress.<br />\nIt is a sequel to Culture Brain&#39;s previous title, Little Ninja Brothers for the NES and contains a few cameos from other Culture Brain&#39;s games.</p>"
