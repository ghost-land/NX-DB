Predator&#39; crossover franchise, it was first introduced to the SNES on January 8th, 1993, which shone a spotlight on two sensational sci-fi movies at the time.</h2>\n<p>Despite both movie titles being Western features, the original release made to Japan differed heavily in comparison to its following international releases. Some of these alterations (JP) included several game differences, such as &quot;Predator&quot; moving slower but having a dash, charging meters, and a two-player versus mode.</p>\n<p>Declare your allegiance as either two monstrosities: &quot;Xenomorph&quot; (&#39;Alien&#39; 1979) or Yautja (&#39;Predator&#39; 1987), who must come face-to-face in a ring of pure vengeance. Travel across 6 fiery monster-infested stages as you root for your chosen fighter, either solo or against a friend of your choosing (JP), in an all-out blood fest to determine who&#39;s the mightiest of them all!</p>"
