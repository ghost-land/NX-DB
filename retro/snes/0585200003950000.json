    "description": "<p>Paladin&#39;s Quest, originally released as Lennus: Kodai Kikai no Kioku (\u30ec\u30ca\u30b9 \u53e4\u4ee3\u6a5f\u68b0\u306e\u8a18\u61b6, &quot;Lennus: Memories of an Ancient Machine&quot;) in Japan, is a Utopian/Dystopian science fantasy role-playing video game developed by Copya System and published in Japan by Asmik Corporation on November 13, 1992, for the Super Famicom. It was published in North America by Enix in October 1993. It was different from other role-playing games at the time, because when the player casts magic, it takes away HP (health points) instead of MP (magic points/power).<br />\nIts sequel, Lennus II, was only released in Japan.</p>"
