    "description": "<p>The future of racing is here! F-ZERO, an intergalaxtic Grand Prix, uses machines that weigh more than a ton, reach dash speeds of over 500km/h and hover a mere twelve inches off the ground! Choose from the heroic Captain Falcon, or the suave, Dr. Stuart. Need more choices? Then try the sly alien, Pico or the not-so-honest Samurai Goroh, and race for intergalactic fame and fabulous fortune in the F-ZERO Grand Prix.</p>"
