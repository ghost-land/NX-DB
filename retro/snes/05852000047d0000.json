    "description": "<p>\n      Experience one of gaming\u2019s iconic franchises in this perfect rendition \n      of the arcade classic! Take aim at the field of invaders relentlessly \n      marching toward you. Move quickly, but carefully, and use the barriers \n      for protection as you avoid missiles fired by the aliens and try to \n      destroy all of them before they reach the bottom of the screen. Further \n      enhance the nostalgia by choosing from several modes that simulate \n      different versions of the arcade game (such as upright cabinet or black \n      and white). Or if you want to prove your superior skills to a friend, \n      try the brand-new VS mode and see who can stop the alien menace the \n      quickest. All in all, it\u2019s pure gaming at its best, now with no quarters \n      required!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. See more Virtual Console games for Wii.</p>"
