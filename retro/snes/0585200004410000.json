    "description": "<p>In La-Mulana, the player assumes the role of an adventurer archeologist and explores the ruins of a forgotten ancient civilization.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game follows an archeologist named Lemeza Kosugi. He continues the research of the lost city of La-Mulana that was started by his father Shorn. La-Mulana is a magical place that the protagonist believes was the source of all human civilizations. Its architecture consists of a mixture of various ancient cultures, such as Greek, Egyptian or Maya. Lemeza discovers that all human civilizations were created by an alien &quot;Mother&quot; with a goal to help it return to space.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player controls Lemeza in a 2D environment. The main character has to explore the levels that consist of many mazes, platforms, and environmental puzzles. The levels are non-linear, and the player can complete the game in a variety of ways, although there are no alternate endings. Lemeza can use his whip to fight enemies or to break some parts of the environment to clear the way.</p>\n<h3>Style</h3>\n<p>The game intentionally imitates the retro style of 16-bit console games from the 90s. It uses a limited color palette and pixelated visuals. La-Mulana is also obviously inspired by the Indiana Jones film series. The main character wears a fedora, fights with a whip and is very similar to Indiana. The game is set to the music typically associated with old adventure films.</p>"
