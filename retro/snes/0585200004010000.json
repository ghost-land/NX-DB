    "description": "<p>Rock n&#39; Roll Racing is a vehicular combat-based racing video game developed by Silicon &amp; Synapse (now known as Blizzard Entertainment) and published by Interplay Productions for the Mega Drive/Genesis and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1993. The game prominently features a number of popular heavy metal and rock songs in its soundtrack, hence the game&#39;s title. The game was ported to the Game Boy Advance in 2003.<br />\nRock n&#39; Roll Racing was initially developed as RPMII, a sequel to the company&#39;s SNES game RPM Racing. At the end of the project, Interplay marketing added licensed music and changed the name to Rock n&#39; Roll Racing. It is also similar in gameplay to Racing Destruction Set where it got its logic/AI engine and the NES game R.C. Pro-Am developed by Rare in 1988.</p>"
