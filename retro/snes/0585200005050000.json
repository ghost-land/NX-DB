    "description": "<p>Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.\u00ae 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western Hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress). If that\u2019s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game\u2019s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again. Just don\u2019t be surprised if she\u2019s in another castle! This game is only playable in 2D.This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.</p>"
