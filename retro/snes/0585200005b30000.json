    "description": "<p>\r\n      Feeling under the weather? Well, Dr. Mario has the cure for you! Help \r\n      him fight bodies of nasty viruses with multi-colored vitamins, \r\n      eliminating those germs faster than they can multiply. Rotate the \r\n      vitamins as they drop, and gain a higher score by aligning multiples of \r\n      the same color. Clear all of the viruses to move on to the next round. \r\n      But watch out as the vitamins start dropping at a faster rate! Not \r\n      enough of a challenge? Try competing against a buddy, and prove that \r\n      you're just what the doctor prescribed!\r\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
