    "description": "<p>Nightmare Busters is a run and gun action video game developed by the French company Arcade Zone for the Super Nintendo. Originally planned for a 1995 release by Nichibutsu, the game was cancelled due to financial issues, but its development was resumed by Arcade Zone in the 2010s after fans who played beta cartridges of it called for an official release, which took place on December 23, 2013 by Super Fighter Team. The game's unusually tardy release, about fourteen years after the Super Nintendo was discontinued in North America, makes it the first official Super Nintendo game after this period.</p>"
