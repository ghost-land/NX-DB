    "description": "<p>Mohawk &amp; Headphone Jack is a 1996 2D rotational game released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.</p>\n<p>The game was developed by Solid Software, published by THQ and distributed by Electro Source. The programming credit for the game is held by D. Scott Williamson. The game spins around and around wildly in a circle, changing the rotation of the map also, and making it difficult to continue in the right direction. Rock music plays in the background as one or two players attempt to negotiate a treacherous series of platforms throughout the game's 14 levels.</p>"
