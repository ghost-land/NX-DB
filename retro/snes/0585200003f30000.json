    "description": "<p>Ranma \u00bd: Hard Battle (Japanese: \u3089\u3093\u307e1/2 \u7206\u70c8\u4e71\u95d8\u7bc7, Hepburn: Ranma Nibun-no-Ichi: Bakuretsu Rant\u014dhen), known in Europe as just Ranma \u00bd, is a 2-D fighting video game released by Masaya and DTMC for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It is based on the manga and anime series Ranma \u00bd. Hard Battle is the second Ranma \u00bd game to be translated into English, this time keeping the original graphics, music, and names of the characters, though the voices were still dubbed into English. The game&#39;s English translation (but not its English voice acting) was provided by Viz Media.</p>"
