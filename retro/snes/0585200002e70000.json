    "description": "<p>MechWarrior, known in Japan as Battletech (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c6\u30c3\u30af), is a first-person action video game for the Super NES based on the Battletech universe. The SNES game was based upon the original PC MechWarrior, with updated graphics that utilized Mode 7 for the Battlemech mission sequences instead of the PC version&#39;s flat-shaded 3D graphics.<br />\nThe game was followed by a sequel, MechWarrior 3050, which was played from an isometric view.</p>"
