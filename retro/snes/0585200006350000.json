    "description": "<p>Wolverine: Adamantium Rage is a platform-action video game released for both the Super NES and the Sega Genesis in 1994. The Genesis version was published by Acclaim and developed by Teeny Weeny Games, while the Super NES version had LJN as the publisher, and Bits Studios as the development studio. Both versions of the title were developed separately and differed from one another in some key areas, but their opening storyline and gameplay remain similar. It's one of the first video games to feature a recharging health system, though Wolverine has been able to recharge his health in previous X-Men games.</p>"
