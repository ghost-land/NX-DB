    "description": "<p>Wario's Woods (Japanese: \u30ef\u30ea\u30aa\u306e\u68ee, Hepburn: Wario no Mori) is a puzzle game developed and published by Nintendo, released on the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Super NES (SNES) video game consoles. It was released in Japan on February 19, 1994 and in North America on December 10, 1994 and in Europe in 1995. The SNES version was released in North America in December 1994.</p>\n<p>Wario's Woods is a falling block game where the objective is to clear the playing field of monsters by using bombs, arranging them into rows of matching colors. Unlike other puzzle games such as Tetris, where the player directly manipulates the game pieces, the player controls Toad, who moves around the playing field and arranges them after they have fallen.</p>\n<p>The game was re-released multiple times, first as a broadcast on the Satellaview from April 23, 1995 to June 30, 2000, and as a Virtual Console title for the Wii in 2006 and for the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U in 2013.</p>"
