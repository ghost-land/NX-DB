    "description": "<p>Ken Griffey Jr.&#39;s Winning Run is a baseball video game developed by Rare for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System that is named after the baseball player Ken Griffey Jr. It is the follow-up to Nintendo&#39;s previous Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball. Two years later, Nintendo released another game featuring Griffey, Major League Baseball Featuring Ken Griffey Jr., for the Nintendo 64.<br />\nThe game&#39;s title is derived from the final play of the 1995 American League Division Series featuring the Seattle Mariners and New York Yankees. On a play that is sometimes credited with &quot;saving baseball in Seattle,&quot; Griffey scored the game&#39;s winning run all the way from first base, on a close play in the bottom of the 11th inning.<br />\nDue to the lack of a Major League Baseball Players&#39; Association license, Griffey is the only player in the game to use his actual name.</p>"
