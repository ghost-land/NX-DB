    "description": "<p>Super Aleste (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30a2\u30ec\u30b9\u30bf), known in North America as Space Megaforce, is a vertically scrolling shoot 'em up video game developed by Compile. It was published by Toho in 1992 for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System as part of the Aleste series. In a traditional fashion, the player pilots a spaceship through a variety of locales crawling with enemy squadrons to shoot down, though the story in the Japanese version is different from American and European ones. However, Super Aleste also offers a \"Short Game\", where only a set of small levels are played, with the emphasis on scoring as many points as possible.</p>"
