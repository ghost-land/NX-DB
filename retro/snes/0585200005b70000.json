    "description": "<p>Tetris Attack is a 1995 puzzle video game developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy. It is the first game in the Puzzle League series. While it was originally known in Japan as Panel de Pon (\u30d1\u30cd\u30eb\u3067\u30dd\u30f3 Paneru de Pon) for the Super Famicom and featured different art assets and characters, its English localization was replaced with characters from Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island. It was released on the Game Boy under the same name. The Game Boy release of the Yoshi version was also later released in Japan. On November 3, 1996, a version was released for the Super Famicom's Satellaview satellite modem service as BS Yoshi's Panepon (\uff22\uff33\u30e8\u30c3\u30b7\u30fc\u306e\u30d1\u30cd\u30dd\u30f3, B\u012b Esu Yossh\u012b no Panepon). This game is similar to Baku Baku Animal, developed by Sega and released in 1995.</p>\n<p>Despite using the Tetris name, this game has no resemblance to its Russian namesake. This has led Henk Rogers of The Tetris Company to say that he regrets granting permission to Nintendo to use the name.</p>"
