    "description": "<p>NCAA Basketball - known as World League Basketball in Europe and Super Dunk Shot (\u30b9\u30fc\u30d1\u30fc\u30c0\u30f3\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30c8) in Japan - is a basketball video game which was developed by Sculptured Software for the Super NES.</p>\n<p>It was the first basketball game for a console to utilize a 3D perspective. The game uses the Super Nintendo's Mode 7 to create a 3D players' perspective that became the standard for later basketball video games. Sculptured's NHL Stanley Cup featured a similar effect.</p>\n<p>According to short-lived Flux magazine, which originated in the United States, this video game was declared to be the 75th best video game of all time.</p>"
