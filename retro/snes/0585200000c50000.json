    "description": "<p>Crystal Beans From Dungeon Explorer, is kind of a port of Dungeon Explorer II for the Super Famicom, but heavily reworked. The intro has completely changed, for starters, which consists mostly of a text scroll. Some of the character classes have changed \u2013 they include Witch, Fighter, Warrior, Bow Master, Wizard, Priest, Monk and Kage (Ninja) \u2013 but all of the sprites have been redrawn to look more cartoony.</p>"
