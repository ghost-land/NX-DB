    "description": "<p>Your mischievous cat, Mimi, sneaks out during the night and is trying to play some hide-and-seek with you in the dark! Let's get your flashlight and look for her.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Here're some tips on how to find and catch her:</p>\n<ul><li>Hold left click to turn on the flashlight</li><li>Try to catch Mimi back ASAP but be careful not to scare her away! She'd drop your flashlight and run away immediately if she finds out</li><li>A good way to turn off your flashlight (release left click) once you spot part of her. Then try to aim at her body precisely and turn on your flashlight! Then she'd have no way to escape</li></ul>\n<p>This is a game project made during the game jam held by my uni's Game Development Society. The theme of this jam is\u00a0One Button, which means I can only use one specific button input throughout the game, and I chose \"Left Click\". This has been a very fun experience to kickstart my first week of uni, thanks to GDS :D</p>"
