    "description": "<p>Lennus II: Fuuin no Shito was released on July 26, 1996, three years after its predecessor, and a full month after the Nintendo 64; accordingly, it featured much-improved graphics and sound. The plot centers around a hero, Farus, who must find four orbs to avert apocalypse. Farus is the only character central to the player&#39;s party; other members are recruited and may be dismissed if a superior replacement is found. The music was critically acclaimed, and two of its tracks were recorded by the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra for release on the Orchestral Game Concert compilations. </p>\n<p>Has a fan translation.</p>"
