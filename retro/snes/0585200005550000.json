    "description": "<p><strong>Super-Nova</strong> is a superhero-themed visual novel set in the fictional city of Nova. The story follows Nick, a college junior who unexpectedly finds himself drawn into a world of superpowered heroes and villains. After joining\u00a0a superhero team, the raccoon will be able to\u00a0choose a mentor to guide him as they tackle all that Nova City has to offer. <br/></p>\n<p>The visual novel will branch into three routes based on the choice of mentor: the friendly yet mysterious fox Mnesis; the cheerful, enthusiastic tiger Superfang; and the prickly, brash Baron-in-Black. Each route will explore a different facet of the story and world as you forge a stronger bond with your chosen superhero and uncover more of what lies beneath their masks.<br/></p>\n<p>As such, apart from all the juicy superhero action, the visual novel will also feature elements of romance.<br/></p>\n<p><strong>Super-Nova is a gay, furry project with mature elements, and is therefore not suitable for minors. </strong><br/></p>\n<p>____________________________________________________________</p>\n<p>If you wish to support the project, please consider supporting us on <strong>Patreon</strong>.
