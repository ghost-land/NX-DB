    "description": "<p>Extra Innings (\u767d\u71b1\u30d7\u30ed\u91ce\u7403 \u30ac\u30f3\u30d0\u30ea\u30fc\u30b0, Hakunetsu Puro Yaky\u016b Ganba R\u012bgu, titled Hakunetsu Pro Yakyuu Ganba League in Japan) is a 1991 traditional baseball simulation video game released for the Super NES. The game features 12 fictional teams composed of their own fictional players, drawn in an anime style. Players can also create two custom teams, the players of which can have their names and ratings edited any number of times. For the most part, the game adhered to realistic rules of baseball; it omitted some more complex strategies such as the double switch.</p>\n<p>Extra Innings's controls were unlike many of the era, featuring pitches with vertical break, diving and sliding catches that could be assisted by the AI, and independent runner control (selecting the destination base with the D-pad and Y would advance the runner; the origin base on the D-pad and B would make an individual runner retreat).</p>\n<p>This could be exploited in this and subsequent Japanese versions of the game with runners on first and third in single player. The AI will attempt to put out any runner advancing toward a base. With practice, the player can alternate between advancing and retreating both runners until the computer could not keep up with both; producing cheap runs.</p>\n<p>Like most baseball video and computer games, either one or two players can join in for simultaneous play.</p>"
