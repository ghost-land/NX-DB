    "description": "<p>Ivan \"Ironman\" Stewart's Super Off Road is an arcade video game released in 1989 by Leland Corporation. The game was endorsed by professional off road racer Ivan Stewart. Virgin Games produced several home versions in 1990. In 1991, a home console version for the Nintendo Entertainment System was later released by Leland's Tradewest subsidiary, followed by versions for most major home formats including the Master System, Genesis, Super NES, Amiga, and MS-DOS. Some of the ports removed Ivan Stewart's name from the title due to licensing issues and are known simply as Super Off Road.</p>"
