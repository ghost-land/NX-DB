    "description": "<p>Super Famicom Wars inherits the familiarity of the Famicom Wars battle system. Rather than pursuing full-scale war simulation with many elements as it is, we have finished it as an introduction to war simulation for home video game consoles, made especially for beginners. You can think of it as one of the games that both parents and children can enjoy together like shogi.</p>"
