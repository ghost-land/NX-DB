    "description": "<p>Wizardry Gaiden IV: Throb of the Demon&#39;s Heart is a turn-based dungeon crawler RPG for the Super Famicom. It is the fourth in a series of &quot;gaiden&quot; Wizardry games developed by Japanese studio Access and influenced heavily by Sir-Tech&#39;s core Wizardry series. The game was fan translated in late 2016.</p>\n<p>Throb of the Demon&#39;s Heart is distinctive for the Wizardry series for adapting a lot of Japanese imagery and monsters in the familiar Wizardry format. This gives it a more home-grown feel among the Japanese-exclusive spin-offs, and heavily draws from Japanese folklore and religion.</p>\n<p>It is the first Wizardry Gaiden to be released on a system other than the Nintendo Game Boy, and is also the last in the series. Many more Japanese Wizardry spin-off games would follow, however.</p>"
