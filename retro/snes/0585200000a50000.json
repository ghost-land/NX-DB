    "description": "<p>The year 2007 has been crowned with the release of Chrono Trigger: Prophet&#39;s Guile, a short but detailed ROM hack from Kajar Laboratories illustrating the events of Magus&#39;s rise to prophethood in Zeal and steps towards staging his shot at revenge in the Ocean Palace. The release is momentous; it is the first new complete, storied ROM hack in Chrono fandom, and a decisive victory for a community which has had too few ROM hackers and too many ambitious dreams. That can all change, though, as Prophet&#39;s Guile is showing. Warning - For reasons unknown at this time, SNES9x freezes during a certain part, so you&#39;ll have to play it with ZSNES.</p>"
