    "description": "<p>True Golf Classics: Wicked 18 - known in Japan as New 3D Golf Simulation: Devil's Course (New 3D Golf Simulation: \u30c7\u30d3\u30eb\u30ba\u30b3\u30fc\u30b9) is a golfing video game originally released in 1993 for the Super NES. A version was later released for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and the Mega Drive. The game takes place on a very difficult otherworldly golf course. It is part of T&amp;E Soft's \"True Golf Classics\" series, but unlike other games in the series which portray actual golf courses such as Pebble Beach and Waialae Country Club, Wicked 18 portrays an entirely fictitious golf course.</p>"
