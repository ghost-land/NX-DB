    "description": "<p>Electronic Super Joy is a platform video game with a humorous tone and numerous levels followed by electronic music. </p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The player performs for a black human-like character. He has to cross through the levels, looking for his stolen butt and seeking revenge for it. The player&#39;s goal is to get through every level and survive after enemies&#39; attacks. As time passes, the game sets three boss fights. </p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>The world is drenched in electronic music; its track supports each level. There are more than 45 levels with different obstructions, enemies, and surroundings.<br />\nThe player passes plenty of checkpoints on each level; it is possible to resume from there if they die. Every stage is covered in a particular color; some of them have portals, bridges, flying stairs, mazes, plants; some surfaces block the player&#39;s movement, or affect him otherwise. There are also moving levels that force the protagonist to move quicker. The character can run, jump and do the \u201csmashing\u201d movement - he then drops upon something directly. At some levels, the player can also fly or double jump. Some of the enemies perform as small white shooting missiles, some of them are black human-like creatures who somehow differ from the protagonist: for example, they might wear a hat. An enemy usually yelps a nasty black-humored phrase like \u201cI stole your butt, it&#39;s true!\u201d</p>"
