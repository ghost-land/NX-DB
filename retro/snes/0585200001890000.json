    "description": "<p>\n      Following the defeat and subsequent disappearance of the Mad Gear Gang, \n      a small group known only as \"Skull Cross\" is responsible for a new \n      uprising of vandalism, terrorism and death. The government of Metro City \n      is at a complete loss. Metro City's mayor, Mike Haggar, and Guy are \n      prepared to take on the new gang, but before they can act, the door \n      bursts open, revealing Lucia, Cody's old friend. \"Metro City is under \n      attack!\" she shouts, \"Skull Cross is loose, and they've got something up \n      their sleeves.\" But before any of them can move, a mysterious man \n      appears in the doorway. \"My name is Dean,\" he says. \"I know Skull Cross \n      inside-and-out, and I hate them more than anything. I can help you, and \n      you can help me. We must go!\" All four fighters vow to bring Skull Cross \n      down. It will be a tough assignment, and may even be their final fight!\n    </p><p>This game is only playable in 2D.</p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
