    "description": "<p>Ball Bullet Gun: Survival Game Simulation is a Japan-exclusive turn-based strategy game for the Super Famicom. The game allows the player to create a party of &quot;soldiers&quot;, though the implication is that these are regular civilians taking part in a military simulation, and determine their names, faces and loadouts. The player then takes this team through a series of missions, using whichever members best fit the criteria.</p>\n<p>The game makes heavy use of fog of war, making it impossible to see the enemy&#39;s team unless they get within visual range. The player characters can use cover and change the direction they&#39;re facing, which allows them to get the drop on enemies. Everything - movement and reloading or shooting a weapon - requires a finite number of &quot;AP&quot; that replenishes after each turn. Both sides take turns to be the remaining team on the field.</p>"
