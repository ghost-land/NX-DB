    "description": "Rocketboat - Pilot is an action/adventure platformer which features a unique graphic style that mixes classic minimalist pixel art with modern 3D rendering techniques. The short, roughly one hour long gaming experience tells a humorous story with memorable characters while giving nods to nostalgic gaming and sci-fi clich\u00e9s, conspiracy culture, the Illuminati, and even the hacktivist group Anonymous. Tying it all together is an 8-bit retro soundtrack influenced by the band\u2019s music.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Use gamepad for best controls!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Turn on shadows via Options &gt; Display!<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Find hidden music notes to unlock jukebox featuring an original Rocketboat recording and chiptune remake.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n* Collect all planet points to unlock Challenge Mode!"
