The original Fighter's History was first released for the arcades in 1993 and then ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1994. Two different sequels were produced: Fighter's History Dynamite (\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba\u30d2\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c0\u30a4\u30ca\u30de\u30a4\u30c8, Fait\u0101zu Hisutor\u012b Dainamaito), known in Europe as Karnov's Revenge, for the Neo Geo in 1994, followed by Fighter's History: Mizoguchi Kiki Ippatsu!!

By repeatedly hitting an opponent's weak point, the player can temporarily stun them once per round, leaving the opponent open for an attack. The location of an opponent's weak spot varies with each character and is usually represented by a specific article of clothing (i.e.: a headband, a vest, a mask).</p>"
