    "description": "<p>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Fighting Edition is a 2D competitive fighting video game based on the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers television series that was released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System developed by Natsume and published by Bandai in 1995. Unlike previous Power Rangers video games, which had the player controlling the titular heroes, the player controls their giant robots (known as Zords) in this title. The developers would later use the same engine for the Super Famicom fighting game Shin Kid\u014d Senki Gundam Wing: Endless Duel.</p>"
