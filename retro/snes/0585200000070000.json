    "description": "<p>A.S.P. Air Strike Patrol (known as Desert Fighter in Europe and Desert Fighter: Suna no Arashi Sakusen (\u30c7\u30b6\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fc\uff1a\u7802\u306e\u5d50\u4f5c\u6226) in Japan) is an isometric shoot 'em up published by SETA for the SNES.</p>\n<p>The game is based somewhat upon the Gulf War. As a pilot in the Air Strike Patrol, the player's aim is to stop Zarak from invading Sweit.</p>\n<p>The player gains points for judgement in managing resources, attack power and political sensitivity. The total of these determines which text is displayed when the game is finished. The dogfights make the game more diverse and the cheat options e.g. ability to destroy buildings with the chain gun give variety. Lots of optional targets to destroy on the open map too but take too long and you fail the mission.</p>"
