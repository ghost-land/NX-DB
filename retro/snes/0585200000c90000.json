    "description": "<p>Cyber Knight (\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fc\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8, Saib\u0101 Naito) is a science fiction PC Engine and Super Famicom role-playing video game that combines sci-fi space exploration with strategic robot combat. This game is intended for experienced role-playing gamers only. The random encounters are high even for a Japanese role-playing game with a mid-to-late 1992 Super Famicom release date (i.e., Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride) and the combat sequences (using melee attacks in addition to missiles and guns) are extremely slow. Two years later, a sequel was released for this game titled Cyber Knight II: Chiky\u016b Teikoku no Yab\u014d. The games were only released commercially in Japan, however there are a fan-translations from Japanese to English by Aeon Genesis.</p>"
