    "description": "<p>Arcana, originally released as Card Master: Rimsalia no Fuuin (\u30ab\u30fc\u30c9\u30de\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc \u30ea\u30e0\u30b5\u30ea\u30a2\u306e\u5c01\u5370), is a 1992 RPG for the SNES by HAL Laboratory. The game represents all of its characters as cards, but plays like a dungeon-crawling RPG, rather than a card-based game. In keeping with this metaphor, the death of a character results in a 'torn' card, and the magical properties of some cards are used to explain abilities of the game's characters.</p>"
