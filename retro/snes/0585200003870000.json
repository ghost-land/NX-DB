    "description": "<p>Operation Logic Bomb: The Ultimate Search &amp; Destroy, known in Japan as Ikari no Y\u014dsai (\u6012\u308a\u306e\u8981\u585e, &quot;The Fortress of Fury&quot;) is a 1993 overhead action video game developed and published by Jaleco for the Super NES/Famicom. It was first released in Japan on April 23, 1993, and later in North America in September 1993. It is the second sequel to the Game Boy game Fortified Zone, following the Japan-only Game Boy sequel Ikari no Y\u014dsai 2. Although the Japanese version shares the same title as the original Game Boy game, it isn&#39;t a remake. It was later re-released as BS Ikari no Y\u014dsai on the Satellaview system.</p>"
