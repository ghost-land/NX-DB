    "description": "<p>An intentionally silly fighting game set in the world of the Old Testament,\u00a0\u00a0inspired by a passage\u00a0where David boasts of his ability to fight beasts bare-handed while still a shepherd and not King.</p>\n<p>To get started, select (Keyboard) and (C)olor after starting the game and then press P to play. Move using the arrow keys. Once in the game, you can pause by pressing P and unpause by moving.</p>"
