    "description": "<p>Shadowgrounds: Survivor is the sequel to Shadowgrounds (2006). It is a near future science fiction game with a top-down view.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game is set on a space colony on Ganymede, the moon of Jupiter, during an alien invasion. The player controls three main protagonists, and each of them is introduced at a certain level. The first playable character, Luke, is a space marine, who is searching for the survivors after the invasion. The second is Bruno, nicknamed Napalm, who is a pest control specialist trying to get to the New Atlantis colony. The third is Isabel, a female sniper who tries to warn the colony of the approaching enemy army.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The sequel is similar in many ways to the original Shadowgrounds but also has its distinct features. Unlike its predecessor, Survivor has a stronger emphasis on action rather than plot. The game features fewer quests to complete and more straightforward levels that the player needs to simply walk through to the end. However, the sequel also introduced a typical role-playing skill mechanic that allows the player to improve the characters abilities. The player can also upgrade his or her weapons, some of which are new, but most are the same as in the original.</p>\n<h3>Survival mode</h3>\n<p>The game introduces a new mode in which the player has to survive alien attacks for as long as possible. In this mode, the player gains points both for killing enemies and staying alive. The maps only become available in the Survivor mode after you complete them in the story mode.</p>"
