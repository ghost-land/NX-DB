Become a Pok\u00e9mon Trainer and set out for<br />\nadventure in a visually stunning new region filled with new Pok\u00e9mon to<br />\ncatch, trade, and battle. In Pok\u00e9mon-Amie, you can pet, feed, and play<br />\nwith your Pok\u00e9mon to form a deeper bond, which may benefit you in future<br />\nbattles. Plus, you can connect and communicate with players around the<br />\nworld at any time to challenge them to a battle, trade Pok\u00e9mon, and much<br />\nmore.</p>\n<p>Please note: a new system update on December 12, 2013 fixes an<br />\ninternet communication issue and occasional bugs that cause Pokemon not<br />\nto learn new moves after evolving through Wonder Trade, and where<br />\ncertain captions for Trainer PR Videos were not unlocked in Lumiose<br />\nCity. This update also fixes a previous bug related to resuming your<br />\ngame after saving in Lumiose City, and updates the filtering feature<br />\nwithin the Global Trade Station.</p>\n<p>We strongly recommend that all Pok\u00e9mon X and Pok\u00e9mon Y players download<br />\nand install this update data. Scan the QR Code pattern below using a<br />\nNintendo 3DS system while connected to the internet. The update data for<br />\nPok\u00e9mon X differs from that of Pok\u00e9mon Y, so make sure you scan the QR<br />\nCode for the version of the game you own.</p>"
