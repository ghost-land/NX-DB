    "description": "<p>Camera Obscura is an indie puzzle platformer game developed by Anteater Games.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>Many years ago, a mysterious cult tried to reach the sun by building a tower. Fast forward to the present day, a curious photographer overhears the fact of the tower actually existing and sets out to find it. His goal is to rich it&#39;s top.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Camera Obscura takes inspiration from Braid, Fez, and Ghosts and Goblins. The game uses the same storytelling principles that are used in these games, and death is not a major setback in the game. It was designed in a way to relax the players and make them feel safe without getting too repetitive or hard.</p>\n<p>Camera Obscura introduces an innovative mechanic to its gameplay. The players can take a shot of their surroundings and use these shots to traverse through the levels. This feature is mainly used to reach elevated places or cross a pit. There are 57 levels present in the game, with each one of them introducing a completely new puzzle to solve. These levels are divided into 8 zones which have a unique atmosphere and sound design for them.</p>\n<p>The game also comes bundled with a custom level editor. The players do not need any programming knowledge to create a level. It is possible to place platforms, doors, and enemies by dragging and dropping them to the required spot.</p>"
