    "description": "<p>Back with another project. I saw someone post the ripped iconset from RPG Maker Fes on The Spriters Resource website and I wanted to recreate some items I\u00a0thought could be easy to recreate. I ended up recreating and rendering 8 items from the iconset with color variations. In the file download I include the my renders so you guys can check the result and play around with them, they don't look anything special, but when scaled down I feel like they mimic the original iconset pretty well. I\u00a0also made they available in 48x48, 32x32, 24x24.</p>\n<p>Use as you please, share around, support and contact me if you want to chat about it.</p>\n<p>This project is CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0).</p>\n<p>Recreation by: Jardson Jean</p>\n<p>Lady Luck Soft - 2021</p>"
