    "description": "<p>Multiplayer adventure from Torn Banner Studios was released in May 2017.</p>\n<p>The main gameplay mechanic of the game is a team multiplayer shooter from the first person perspective. The main bet was on melee fighting and the magical abilities of the characters. Players could choose from six classes that differed in skills and roles in the game. There are several modes available in the game: deathmatch and various mission options such as Capture the Flag and \u201cPayload\u201d modes.</p>\n<p>The game was available for pre-order on Steam back in 2017 and for the year of its existence, it managed to attract about one million players but never found its core audience despite multiple positive reviews from the press. It was removed in May 2018 from public access due to the inability to comply with the GDPR policy. The Developers confirmed that they ran out of options to keep the game alive and they do not plan to return to it.</p>"
