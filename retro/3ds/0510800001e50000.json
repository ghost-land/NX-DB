    "description": "<p>\n      The story of Shin Megami Tensei IV: Apocalypse focuses on a Hunter cadet \n      protagonist who gets killed by one of the demons treating \n      post-apocalyptic Tokyo as their personal playground. However, the \n      mysterious god Dagda resurrects the protagonist in exchange for his \n      fealty, and sets him on a perilous path that treads a fine line between \n      peace and anarchy. Is Dagda simply an opportunistic lesser god or is he \n      part of something much bigger?\n    </p>"
