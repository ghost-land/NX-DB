    "description": "<p>\n      Ready to make some wool? Pop your sheep into The Shearing Machine and he \n      will hilariously cannonball out, surprised but shorn. Ready to harvest \n      your crops? Hook up the Flying FruitBox-Haybale-Copter that flies around \n      crazily picking up boxes of fruit and grain. With tons of wacky \n      contraptions and goofy animals, Funky Barn 3D, the first farm simulation \n      game for Nintendo 3DS, is not your average farm game.\n    </p>"
