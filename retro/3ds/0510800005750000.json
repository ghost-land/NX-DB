    "description": "<h2>&#39;Ocha-ken no Heya&#39; (\u304a\u8336\u72ac\u306e\u90e8\u5c4b) is a Japanese pet simulation game released for the Game Boy Advance on December 19th, 2003. Based on a variety of different teas, it originated as a children&#39;s toy franchise by (J) SEGA Toys, but has since branched out among Nintendo gaming consoles.</h2>\n<p>Being one of the first video game titles to be released for the franchise, the game opens to an isometric room that the player can use to adopt and foster &quot;ocha-ken&quot; (tea dogs/puppies), as well as having the option for tea cats (ocha-neko). Similar to a dollhouse setting, the player can place and move objects (e.g. furniture, food and toys) to decorate these rooms, which can either be purchased, unlocked through minigames, or received as a reward as the game progresses. These objects can sometimes prompt a unique interaction between it and the pet as they wander around the room.</p>"
