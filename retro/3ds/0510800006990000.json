    "description": "<p>\n      Art Academy\u2122: Lessons for Everyone! is a Nintendo 3DS\u2122 XL title that \n      offers art lessons and art-on-the-go for everyone. An in-game tutor \n      walks you through step-by-step lessons as you explore art theory and \n      concepts behind drawing and painting. The stylus and Touch Screen \n      controls offer a lifelike feel, whether you\u2019re layering paint on stroke \n      by stroke, blending pastels, or shading with the side of the pencil. You \n      can also use these tools in Free Paint, where you can sketch and paint \n      pictures of any subject in a variety of mediums. You can even take 3D \n      pictures of subjects when inspiration hits in the real world and \n      reference them later to turn those subjects into works of art. Then \n      share your artistic creations with friends through a number of simple \n      and easy means.
