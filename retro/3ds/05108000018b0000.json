    "description": "<h2>&#39;FabStyle&#39; (otherwise known as \u30d5\u30a1\u30d6\u30b9\u30bf\u30a4\u30eb) is a Japanese fashion retail romance simulator developed by Ruby Party, which was primarily aimed towards a young female audience. Published by Koei on October 24th, 2011, it was the pet project of Keiko Erikawa, who was a highly influential figure in the game&#39;s development and goal. Erikawa believed firmly that women in Japan had very little exposure in the business industry, and so using this as an opportunity, integrated her own knowledge and experience in the hopes to inspire those who picked up the game.</h2>\n<p>With sleek hair blowing and sunglasses gleaming, strut out of the door into the glamorous world of FabStyle!
