    "description": "<p>\n      Build a tower higher and higher by stacking objects of all shapes and \n      sizes together in any way you can. Balance telephone boxes, road cones, \n      televisions, desks, chairs, curling stones - more than 100 in total - in \n      a giant pile to reach the goal line. Build past mutant birds, hurricane \n      winds and black holes sent by the evil Crash Construction Company as \n      they try to bring your tower crashing down.\n    </p><p>\n      Pile household objects high enough to reach the goal line and hold it \n      for three seconds without it collapsing to complete each floor. If your \n      construction is too weak it'll topple over and come crashing to the \n      ground.\n    </p><p>\n      Follow the story of the Haruno Construction company and their sky-high \n      construction project to build a tower to the moon in the name of justice!\n    </p>"
