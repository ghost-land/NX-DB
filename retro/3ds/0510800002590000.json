    "description": "<p>Nobita no Biohazard (from now on Nobihaza) is a parody of the Biohazard series featuring the cast of Doraemon.</p>\n<p>Despite of being a parody, the game is surprisingly well done, considering the fact that most RPG Maker games are adventure or rpg games, this one features a solid action battle system, with enemies from the Resident Evil universe, as well as adding some custom enemies.</p>\n<p>The game was released on 2007 by aaa. Since then, many people have modified the game and spawned many mods and scenarios which not only expands the Nobihaza universe, but adds some new interesting mechanics and gameplay.</p>\n<p>So this is the one who started the universe of Nobihaza.<br />\nAn english version was released in 2014.</p>"
