    "description": "Wanda is a short and simple story about two lonely robots in a desolate, ruined world. Unlike many other \u2018end-of-the-world\u2019 games, Wanda is not about a tale of desperate survival but about finding companionship, love and hope in a wasteland.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Wanda is a story-focused game but completely free of comprehensible dialogue. The entire story is told through the subtle interactions between the two robots and the environment itself in a \u201cshow, don't tell\" style.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Join this little adventure, solve mini-puzzles and witness the story unfold. Experience a whole new perspective of a post apocalyptic world through art-style reminiscent of a children\u2019s book and delightful soundtracks.<br/><br/>"
