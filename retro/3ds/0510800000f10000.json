    "description": "<p>Never before released in North America, this long-awaited entry in the<br />\nacclaimed Devil Summoner series takes players into a future in which<br />\ntechnology and otherworldly forces meet in a macabre fusion of cyberpunk<br />\nfuturism and gothic horror. A first-person sci-fi RPG epic, Soul Hackers<br />\ntells of a city held up as a beacon of humanity&#39;s triumph of technology,<br />\nbut with an infernal secret. In this would-be utopia, a group of hackers<br />\ntakes on a centuries-old mystic society, and a battle for control over<br />\nhumanity&#39;s fate is about to begin...</p>\n<p>In a society originated from a bizarre marriage of technology and<br />\ndemonology, an unleashed evil\u2014borne of an inconvenient truth\u2014threatens<br />\nto bring an end not just to the deceptive harmony, but to mankind itself.</p>\n<p>Improved graphics marry with extensive voice acting, a host of technical<br />\nenhancements, and 3D dungeon exploration to make Soul Hackers a natural<br />\nfit to the Nintendo 3DS.</p>\n<p>The portable COMP units allow players to tap into the tech-heavy world<br />\nand can be upgraded to offer new features and abilities. In tandem with<br />\ntech, demons can be recruited (through negotiation), leveled and even<br />\nfused, giving the player new summoning potential in battle.</p>"
