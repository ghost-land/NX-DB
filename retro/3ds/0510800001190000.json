    "description": "<p>\n      Cave Story 3D is a side scrolling action adventure game inspired by the \n      fan-favorite 2D original. Now in a full 3D world, Cave Story takes the \n      proven 2D action, exploration into stereoscopic awesomeness. You wake up \n      in a cave with no idea who you are or where you came from, but you know \n      you must help a cute race of rabbit-like creatures beat up some crusty \n      old doctor.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      As you advance through the game, you\u2019ll learn the origin of the Mimiga \n      world and even your own. Like the critically acclaimed Pixel \n      masterpiece, Cave Story 3D is a combination of high-speed shooting \n      action scenes with heavy emphasis on platforming, exploration, light \n      puzzle solving as well as a deep storyline.\n    </p><p>\n      Cave Story 3D embodies the unmistakable Cave Story feel in a new 3 \n      dimensional form. The legendary game mechanics are now combined with \n      cutting edge graphics, remixed soundtracks, and additional contents to \n      give new life.\n    </p>"
