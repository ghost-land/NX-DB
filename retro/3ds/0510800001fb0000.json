    "description": "<p>Crayon Shin-Chan 2: Dai Maou no Gyakushu (&quot;Crayon Shin-Chan 2: The Demon Lord&#39;s Counterattack&quot;) is a platformer based on the Crayon Shin-Chan anime and manga. The player, as the mischievous kindergartner Shin-chan, must rescue his favorite super hero Action Kamen (&quot;Action Mask&quot;) from his prison before Action Kamen&#39;s supervillain nemesis Haiguremaou can take over both Action Kamen&#39;s and Shin-chan&#39;s worlds. Many of the bosses are transformed versions of Shin-chan&#39;s friends and family.</p>\n<p>The game is a standard side-scrolling 2D platformer - common with licensed games - though it is notable for letting players decide which order they want to tackle stages, not to mention the franchise&#39;s penchant for weird/gross-out humor. It is the second of three Shin-Chan games to reach the Super Famicom (sandwiched between 1993&#39;s Crayon Shin-Chan: Arashi wo Yobu Enji and 1996&#39;s Crayon Shin-Chan: Osagusu Dobon) and was never released outside of Japan.</p>"
