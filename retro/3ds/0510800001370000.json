    "description": "<strong>My Exotic Farm is a farm building simulation game...</strong><br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all you own is an empty field, a few pennies and a single little ostrich... You need to feed your ostrich, take care of it and improve its lifestyle.<br/>Well-fed with seed, your ostrich will lay eggs which can then be sold to the Shopkeeper. With this money, you can buy new animals at the Farmers\u2019 Market.<br/><br/>So, the aim of the game is to increase your money counter by selling eggs and other farm produce, so as to buy more livestock at the Farmers\u2019 Market and purchase equipment for your farm from the Shopkeeper. Little by little as your farm builds up, you will unlock certain bonuses: a wind turbine, a totem, a guard dog, a jeep, a barbecue, etc."
