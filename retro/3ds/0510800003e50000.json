    "description": "<p>Far off in the mountains, the small village Aslarga becomes a hub for<br />\nadventurers looking for fame and fortune from the Mystery Dungeons. But<br />\ndire challenges await even the most stalwart adventurers in Etrian<br />\nMystery Dungeon, a turn-based action RPG roguelike developed by ATLUS<br />\nand Spike Chunsoft.</p>\n<p>The Nintendo 3DS\u2122 exclusive mixes Etrian Odyssey\u2019s vast RPG party and<br />\nskill customization aspects, and Mystery Dungeon\u2019s infinitely random<br />\ndungeon adventures. The action/turn based combat means that battling<br />\nmonsters is not just about using the right skills, but becomes an<br />\nelegant Pas de Quatre of strategic positioning. Players form their<br />\nparties with familiar Etrian Odyssey classes, customize individuals<br />\nusing Etrian-style skill trees, and then take up to four members into<br />\nthe dungeons. Always randomized with various levels and paths, the<br />\ndungeons require plenty of exploration, not to mention the incredible<br />\nloot rewards -- just be wary of what waits among the deepest depths.</p>"
