In the game, you\u2019ll quickly click the plants and tools on screen and deliver plenty of organs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Irene\u2019s requested organ deliveries are presented as quests. By completing a few quests, more customers will come, and the story will progress. Whether it\u2019s to get Master\u2019s praise, or to please the customer, click away and ship those organs!Creator\u2019s Voice\"My Organic Garden was an idea that has been floating around for a few years.
