    "description": "<p>Regular Show: Mordecai &amp; Rigby in 8-bit Land is the very first video game based on the hit Cartoon Network TV Show. Mordecai and Rigby are trapped inside a video game and must travel through the pixilated land of 8-Bit to find their way out. This hijinx-filled adventure is packed with platforming, space shooting, and old-school top down video game mania, and comes fully loaded with tons of Regular Show characters and jokes.</p>"
