    "description": "Expect the ultimate B-Movie Trash experience! <br/>Don\u00b4t even dare to hope for state-of the art graphics, a proper balancing, professional voice acting or breathtaking script-writing. This here is 100% pure trash, an adventure / shooter hybrid with gazillions of bad jokes, dozens of pop culture references and a hidden, dense net of subversive, intelligent messages related to post-WWII-politics. Oh yes, you need a basic knowledge of pop culture to enjoy the game, and quite some education on politics to really love it, but who cares?<br/><br/>Far more important is:<br/><br/><strong>We got boobies. <br/>We got hookers. <br/>We got Zombies. <br/>We got Nazis. <br/>We got even Nazi-Zombies!</strong><br/><br/>You`re Peter \"Pete\" O`Brannon, a Private Eye. Sounds fascinating? It isn`t, trust me - unless you find it exciting to hunt down cheating husbands and lost dogs while living of cheap Chinese food in shabby motels. THAT would be what Petes job is all about - but luckily for him, he has a good customer paying his bills. It`s GlobalSecure Inc., one of the biggest insurance companies on the East Coast. More exactly, it`s Samantha \"Sam\" Miller who runs their investigation department on insurance fraud. She`s tough, she`s intelligent, she`s better than Pete. By far better. But due to the companies Code of Conduct and some very nasty ethic rules, she`s prevented from taking, erm, \"semi-legal\" steps to gain essential information and proofs. That`s where Pete steps in - for 500 bucks per day + expenses + a nice 20% share of the money the company saves with whatever Pete finds out.<br/><br/>Into the Dark is a playable B-Movie, a trash experience composed out of 60% humor, 30% horror and 10% technical flaws.

We have ran through the game on several Windows 8 systems, we have reports of many players beating the game on Windows 8, but we CANNOT guarantee it works on your side.  <strong>Buy on own risk and RUN THE INTOTHEDARK EXE AS ADMINISTRATOR WITH COMPATIBILITY MODE WINDOWS 7</strong> <br/><br/><strong>Memory Issues:[/b] Into the Dark calls large chunks of your primary 1.85Gig memory block.
