    "description": "<p>Crayon Shin-Chan: Ora no Gokigen Collection is the fifth and final of<br />\nfive Crayon Shin-Chan games for the Game Boy, and the only non-numbered one (not<br />\ncounting the first, which did not have an actual number 1). Unlike Crayon Shin-<br />\nChan 1, 2, and 4, but like Crayon Shin-Chan 3, there is no platforming action in<br />\nthis game, but rather a number of mini-games. Most of the mini-games, however,<br />\nare drawn from the prior 4 games, with only 4 new mini-games.</p>"
