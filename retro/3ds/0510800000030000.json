    "description": "<h2>&#39;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2 Professional&#39; (otherwise known as \u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u30af\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30e2\u30f3\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30ba \u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc2 \u30d7\u30ed\u30d5\u30a7\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30ca\u30eb) is a revamped and expanded version of its original title, &#39;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2&#39;. Despite its original entry garnering large attraction out of region, this edition of Joker 2 was only made available in Japan on 31st March, 2011. On the bright side, fan-translations have been made to account for this.</h2>\n<p>The revamped version of the game shares the same storyline of its initial entry, although it does stray with adding extra sequences. In addition to that, there&#39;s a few visual changes players of the original may notice, such as the protagonist&#39;s clothing changing from red to blue. There are new maps to explore, with more items to collect and craft.</p>\n<p>As a call back to previous titles of the Dragon Quest series, and as a bonus incentive to pick up the game, the game also includes 100 new monsters to find and synthesize. Most of which come from the recent &#39;Dragon Quest IX&#39; and &#39;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&#39; titles at the time. To go in par with that, there&#39;s a new &quot;final-final&quot; boss for players to seek out- which can prove a challenging opponent compared to other bosses before it!</p>"
