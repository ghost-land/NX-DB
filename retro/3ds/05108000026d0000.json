    "description": "<p>LEGO The Lord of Rings is an adventure game that reimagines the events of the Lord of the Rings film trilogy with humor and Lego style. The game doesn\u2019t follow the plot of the saga directly but features all the characters, major events and voice acting from it.</p>\n<p>There are 80 playable characters in the games, including Frodo Baggins, Legolas and other heroes, even not mentioned in the movies. Each of them has unique abilities and their own inventory. You can also create your own character. You play as a part of the party that needs to destroy the Ring. Besides the story mode, there is a free roam mode where you can explore the open world of the game switching between two characters.</p>\n<p>The game keeps the balance between environmental puzzles based on LEGO mechanics, QTE-fights and exploration. Different actions are more suitable for different characters. The game features multiple collectibles, side quests and unlockable heroes.</p>"
