Not being able to live on her meager allowance she goes out in the city to look for a part-time job. She looks so hard she&#39;s at the point of collapsing, but then a certain person saves her on one condition. That condition is that she must become the landlady of the student apartment building the &#39;Meshikessou&#39;. Will she be able to properly perform the duties?
