It is during one such \n      routine excavation that he happens upon a beautiful maiden encased \n      inside a massive crystal, and her abrupt awakening triggers a series of \n      unexpected events that include foul fiends, astonishing abilities, and \n      miraculous mysteries\u2026\n    </p><p>\n      \"Bowl\" over as many enemies with a single strike as possible in this new \n      RPG from the producer of STORY OF SEASONS and Rune Factory, challenging \n      players to line up melee, ranged, and magical attacks so frontline \n      enemies are knocked into others for maximum collateral damage!\n    </p>"
