    "description": "<p>\n      Join Susumu and Anna as a mysterious outbreak of Blocks threaten the \n      world's existence. Armed with a mighty drill, dig deep through \n      multi-colored blocks until reaching safety. Not all of the blocks will \n      be breakable, but be careful that the blocks you break don't end falling \n      on you, or cut off your air supply! Scramble to grab air capsules for a \n      recharge, and you'll be just fine to reach your goal. How deep can you \n      dig underground? Drill to your heart's content in these three modes: \n      Mission Driller, Endless Driller and Time Attack Driller!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. We hope you'll enjoy the new features (including off-TV play) that have been added to this title. See more Virtual Console games for Wii U.</p>"
