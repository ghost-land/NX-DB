    "description": "<p>Polarium Advance (Ts\u016bkin Hitofude (\u901a\u52e4\u30d2\u30c8\u30d5\u30c7) in Japan) is the sequel to the Nintendo DS puzzle game Polarium. Polarium Advance was developed by Mitchell Corporation for the Game Boy Advance. The object of the game is similar to that of Polarium. Black and white tiles fill a grid, and by drawing a single line in the grid, tiles can be flipped from black to white (or vice versa). Solid, horizontal lines of all black or all white tiles are erased, and the goal is to erase the entire grid in this manner.</p>"
