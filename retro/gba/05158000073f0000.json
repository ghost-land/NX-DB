    "description": "<p>Mario&#39;s Game Boy Advance debut gives gamers two games in one: an enhanced version of Super Mario Bros. 2 and an action-packed four-player version of the original Mario Bros. arcade game. First released for the original NES in 1988, Super Mario Bros. 2 makes its debut on the Game Boy Advance with new enemies, improved graphics, and tougher challenges. Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Toad adventure through seven fantasy worlds on a quest to save the day, though they have little more than vegetables for defense. New challenges include collecting red coins and finding Yoshi&#39;s hidden eggs.</p>"
