    "description": "<p>This was the first Mickey Mouse game for Super NES, featuring a traditional platform gameplay and colorful Disney-like graphics.</p>\n<p>Mickey&#39;s mission is to save his dog Pluto, who&#39;s been kidnapped and kept inside emperor Pete&#39;s castle, in a magical land, guarded by mysterious creatures.</p>\n<p>The originality of the game lies on the possibility of wearing different costumes to incorporate different characters, all taken from old Disney cartoons. Each one has a special ability. As a wizard, Mickey has magical powers; as a fireman, the mouse can deal with fire; and, as a climber, he can reach the top of high platforms.</p>"
