It is the fourth game in the Mega Man Battle Network series. Like Battle Network 3 before it, Battle Network 4 has two different versions, Red Sun (Tournament Red Sun in Japan) and Blue Moon (Tournament Blue Moon in Japan), that differ in story and gameplay details. Battle Network 4 is compatible with the e-Reader, and can be linked up with Rockman EXE 4.5 Real Operation and the Battle Chip Gate for NetBattles. It is able to link with Mega Man Zero 3, and contains references to Konami&#39;s Boktai series.</p>"
