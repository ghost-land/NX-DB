    "description": "<p>Mega Man Battle Network 3, known as Battle Network Rockman EXE 3 (\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af \u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc3, Batoru Nettow\u0101ku Rokkuman Eguze Sur\u012b) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is the third game in the Mega Man Battle Network series, released in 2002 in Japan and 2003 in North America. While in North America and Europe, two complementary versions of the game - Blue and White - exist, marketed simultaneously, this was not the case in Japan. The game was released in a single version in this region, while a Black (\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30af, Burakku) version containing bugfixes, new areas, optional bosses, and other improvements, was released some months after the original. It was released on the Wii U&#39;s Virtual Console in Japan on December 17, 2014 and in North America on May 14, 2015.</p>"
