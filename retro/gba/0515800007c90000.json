    "description": "<strong>Pixel Cup Soccer</strong> is a casual retro style soccer game, a great evolution from the previous edition. It's dynamic, arcade, with a fast paced gameplay, just the fun part of soccer! The game has great pixel art graphics like the games from the 90\u2019s, evoking nostalgia.<br/>It features great pixel art and soundtracks that evoke nostalgia of the glory days of the 80\u2019s and 90\u2019s arcade games.<br/><br/>Move, pass, and shoot the ball to victory! You will learn to play in one minute, but it takes much longer to master it.
