    "description": "<p>Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge is a platforming video game developed by Rare and published by THQ for the Game Boy Advance. The game was released in North America on 10 September 2003 and in Europe on 24 October 2003. Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge is a handheld game in the Banjo-Kazooie series and takes place two months after the events of Banjo-Kazooie for the Nintendo 64. The game also contains a time travel plot; its story actually takes place before the events of Banjo-Kazooie as well. Banjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge used an overhead platform design similar to Conker&#39;s Pocket Tales to replicate the 3D feel of the console entries in the series, but on a smaller scale.<br />\nBanjo-Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge was the first Rare game that was released after the company was purchased by Microsoft from the Stamper Brothers, and the first Banjo-Kazooie game to be released on the portable Game Boy Advance and to only be licensed by Nintendo. A port for mobile phones was released in July 2004, and a mobile compilation of the game&#39;s minigames, titled Banjo Kazooie: Grunty&#39;s Revenge Missions, was released on 14 June 2005.</p>"
