    "description": "<p>\n      Based on the DVD movie, Barbie in the 12 Dancing Princesses is the story \n      of Barbie as Genevieve, 1 of 12 sisters who live happily with their \n      father the king. Concerned that the high-spirited independent princesses \n      need more structure to become proper princesses, the king invites his \n      cousin, the Duchess Rowena, to move into the castle. Rather than help, \n      Rowena forbids the sisters from singing and dancing and squelches their \n      individuality. The princesses discover a magical enchanted world and \n      escape the tyranny of Rowena. But when Genevieve learns that their \n      father's life is in danger, the sisters must unite to save the king and \n      their kingdom.<br/>The evil Duchess Rowena has hidden away the princesses \n      in different parts of the castle and is ready to take over the kingdom. \n      Genevieve must explore the castle and royal grounds to release her \n      sisters from their hidden locations.\n    </p>"
