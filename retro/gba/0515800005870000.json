    "description": "<p>Pok\u00e9mon FireRed Version and LeafGreen Version are enhanced remakes of the original Pok\u00e9mon Red and Blue video games, which were released in 1996. The new titles were developed by Game Freak, published by The Pok\u00e9mon Company and distributed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance and have compatibility with the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter, which originally came bundled with the games. FireRed and LeafGreen were first released in Japan in January 2004 and released in North America and Europe in September and October respectively. Nearly two years after their original release, Nintendo re-marketed them as Player&#39;s Choice titles. The two games hold the distinction of being the first enhanced remakes of previous games within the franchise.<br />\nFireRed and LeafGreen are members of the Pok\u00e9mon series of role-playing video games. As in previous games, the player controls the player character from an overhead perspective and participates in turn-based combat encounters. However, new features such as a contextual help menu and a new region the player may access have also been added. Throughout the games, the player captures and raises Pok\u00e9mon for use in battle.<br />\nThe games received mostly positive reviews, obtaining an aggregate score of 81\u00a0percent on Metacritic. Most critics praised the fact that the games introduced new features while still maintaining the traditional gameplay of the series. Reception of the graphics and audio was more mixed, with some reviewers complaining that they were too simplistic and lacked improvement compared to the previous games, Pok\u00e9mon Ruby and Sapphire. FireRed and LeafGreen were commercial successes, selling a total of around 12\u00a0million copies worldwide.</p>"
