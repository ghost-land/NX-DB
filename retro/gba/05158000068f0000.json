    "description": "<p>Shrek SuperSlam is a 3D-environment multiplayer fighting game in which two to four fighter characters battle in a variety of arena stages attempting to beat each other up and charge a special move called a &quot;Slam&quot; attack. When a &quot;Slam&quot; is successfully used on other fighters, the player gains points while continually (and creatively) destroying the arena in the process. Whoever gains the most &quot;Slam&quot; points will win when the round is over.</p>"
