The game was published for PlayStation, Xbox and GameCube by Black Isle Studios, a division of Interplay Entertainment, and distributed by Vivendi Universal Games. The Game Boy Advance version was published by DSI Games. CD Projekt was developing a version for PC, but it was ultimately cancelled.<br />\nThe game is set in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and the gameplay is based on the rules of Dungeons &amp; Dragons 3rd Edition, which were released in 2000. It is the first video game to implement the real time application of the new rules.
