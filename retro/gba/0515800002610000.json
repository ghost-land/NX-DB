    "description": "<p>Two small platforms hang in space, each has a place for the commander and his few, but diverse warriors. Between the platforms there are two bridges. The goal of the game is to capture and hold bridges. The game involved more than three hundred characters.<br />\nYou can fight with players of different levels. There are game modes with the computer and with any partners, friends or players found on the game server on the Internet.<br />\nAfter the end of the battle, you can see all the initial conditions of the opponent in the last game and all his actions in it. It is possible to trace what decisions the enemy took, how he equipped the troops and how he controlled them.<br />\nThe amount of armament and power increases from level to level, from battle to victory. A variety of monsters and fantastic teams are combined in different combinations to conquer and suppress the enemy. Control of the bridge and neutralization of enemy forces - in this game this is the sacred grail, after which the player goes away time and again, honing his mastery of strategic planning.</p>"
