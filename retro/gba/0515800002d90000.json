    "description": "<p>Mr. Slate has just bought a Brontoburger restaurant and guess who&#39;s the chef? Dash from counter to counter while avoiding uninvited prehistoric pests. You can avoid them or attack. But each time they tag you, you&#39;ll lose a life. Lose all your lives and your burger building days are over. Scramble up and down ladders using ingredients to assemble burgers. Bask in the glow of a job well done... until the next one. Play in VS. mode and go head to head against a friend with your Game Link cable. Now, who&#39;s the fastest chef in Bedrock?</p>"
