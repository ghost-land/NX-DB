    "description": "<p>Phantasy Star Collection (\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30b7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30b3\u30ec\u30af\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3, Fantash\u012b Sut\u0101 Korekushon) is the name of two different compilations of Phantasy Star games. The first, released for the Sega Saturn in Japan in 1998, featured the first four games in the series, whereas the Game Boy Advance version, released four years later in North America and five in Europe, featured the first three. The North American and European versions were produced by Digital Eclipse. The Saturn version was later ported to the PlayStation 2 (as Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 32: Phantasy Star Complete Collection) in Japan with more games added.</p>\n<p>Each compilation features ports of the original Phantasy Star games. They are virtually identical to their original versions, as opposed to enhanced remakes. Gameplay has not been altered in each of the collections, but additional options in the Saturn and PlayStation 2 versions can alter the pace and difficulty of the games significantly.</p>"
