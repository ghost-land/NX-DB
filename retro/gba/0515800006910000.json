    "description": "<p>Shrek: Swamp Kart Speedway is a kart racer released in 2002 for the Gameboy Advance. It plays similarly to the game Mario Kart: Super Circuit, except with Shrek locations and characters. </p>\n<p>The game has been heavily criticized for its bad controls, handling and overall sluggishness. It is highly regarded as one of the worst IP-based racing games, only taking second place to another notorious game, M&amp;M&#39;s Kart Racing.</p>"
