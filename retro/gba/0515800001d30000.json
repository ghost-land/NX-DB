    "description": "<p>You&#39;re taking a Tahoe 155 snowboard down a steep, bumpy incline at night and you&#39;re about to top off an Indy Nosebone with a 360 Air, and you haven&#39;t even left your living room! You&#39;re playing 1080 (Ten Eighty) Snowboarding, a game so intense you&#39;ll be brushing the snow off your goggles. With five different boarders, eight different Lamar snowboards, more than 25 tricks, a Half-Pipe and six different courses, this is as close as you&#39;ll get to the real thing without hopping on the next ski lift.</p>"
