At the root of this ever-increasing bug invasion is Oogie Boogie, a former holiday king who is determined to take over Halloween. With help from his friends Sally, the mayor, and Dr. Finklestein, Jack and his trusted pal Zero embark on a quest to rid the town of bugs and stop Oogie Boogie from carrying out his evil plot. As Jack, you must battle Oogie&#39;s creepy henchmen using an arsenal of different weapons and navigate through booby traps, mazes, and puzzles.</p>"
