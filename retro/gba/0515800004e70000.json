    "description": "<p>Mr. Nutz is a side scrolling, 2D platformer video game published by Ocean Software. It was first released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in late 1993, in Europe, then was released in North America and Japan in 1994. The release for the Sega Mega Drive and Game Boy came in late 1994, then Sega Channel in 1995, followed by Game Boy Color in 1999, and Game Boy Advance remake in 2001.</p>\n<p>The player controls the one player character, Mr. Nutz, an anthropomorphic red squirrel wearing Chucks, gloves, a vest, and a cap, through six themed levels. The end goal is to stop Mr. Blizzard, a yeti, who is the final boss and is trying to take over the world by using his magic powers to turn it into a mass of ice. Ammunition, in the form of nuts, can be collected and thrown at enemies.</p>\n<p>Ocean originally planned to release this game also for the Commodore Amiga. After the original conversion plan was shelved, Ocean eventually released in 1994 a different game on the Amiga under the name Mr. Nutz: Hoppin' Mad. Developed by Neon Studios, it featured the same titular character but with different, faster and more wide-open gameplay, unrelated levels and enemies, another story, and a large overworld map instead of a linear path to follow in a mini-map. This game was also going to be released for the Sega Mega Drive in 1995 as Mr Nutz 2, but it got shelved. A playable build exists, leaked in the form of source code and compiled upon.</p>"
