    "description": "<p>Shrek 2&#39;s storyline follows a similar plot to that of the film. Shrek and Fiona are on a journey to the Kingdom of Far Far Away to visit Fiona&#39;s parents. Shrek&#39;s in-laws are not happy that a crude ogre is married to their daughter Fiona and the battle for acceptance ensues. The game covers things not shown in the film. Plot elements are delivered primarily through a storybook interface (text and illustrations) shown before each level.</p>"
