    "description": "<p>As Popo, players use a trusty mallet to work their way up the mountain.<br />\nThey chip away at the blocks overhead, then jump up through the<br />\nresulting hole to the mountain&#39;s next level. Once Popo reaches the top<br />\nlevel, he enters a fast-moving bonus stage in which he can pick up<br />\nveggies and, hopefully, reach the summit for a big point payoff. Of<br />\ncourse, not everyone&#39;s supportive of Popo&#39;s pastime. Toppies fill Popo&#39;s<br />\nholes, so players must jump through the gaps quickly. It&#39;s easy to slip<br />\noff some of the icy levels, as Polar Bears, Toppies, and other ferocious<br />\nfauna don&#39;t want players up there. There are 32 challenging peaks to<br />\nscale. How will you fare?</p>"
