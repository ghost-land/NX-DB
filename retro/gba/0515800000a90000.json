    "description": "<p>Banjo Pilot is a racing video game for the Game Boy Advance developed by Rare and published by THQ. It features characters from the Banjo-Kazooie series of video games.</p>\n<p>The game was originally planned to be entitled Diddy Kong Pilot and to be a sequel to Diddy Kong Racing for the Nintendo 64, but due to Rare being bought out by Microsoft Studios, the characters were changed from those of the Nintendo-based Donkey Kong series to those of the Rare-based Banjo-Kazooie series because Rare no longer held the rights to the Donkey Kong characters. As Microsoft did not compete with Nintendo in portable gaming, Rare was free to develop Banjo Pilot for the Game Boy Advance.</p>"
