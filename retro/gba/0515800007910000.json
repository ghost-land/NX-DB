    "description": "<p>In Tom Clancy\u2019s Splinter Cell\u00ae: Pandora Tomorrow\u2122, you play Sam Fisher, a cold-blooded stealth soldier waging a one-man war against an Indonesian terrorist network. Inspired by the world of Tom Clancy, Pandora Tomorrow features a story line so real you can feel it. Tension-filled stealth action springs from a compelling and original plot that\u2019s so realistic it could\u2019ve been ripped from the headlines by scriptwriter JT Petty, who penned the original Tom Clancy\u2019s Splinter Cell.</p>"
