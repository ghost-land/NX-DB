    "description": "<p>WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 is a video game released on the Game Boy Advance handheld console by THQ in 2002, based on WWE's 2002 pay-per-view WrestleMania X8, their biggest show of the year. The game featured improved gameplay and grappling techniques compared to its predecessors. This game was the Game Boy Advanced successor to WWF Road to WrestleMania from 2001. The game was succeeded by WWE Survivor Series released in 2004. WWE also released WWE WrestleMania X8 for the GameCube in June 2002, making the GBA game in a way the \"prequel\", despite WrestleMania X8 being published five months prior.</p>\n<p>The controls for the game are very limited, as the hand-held Game Boy Advance platform which it is available only has space for very few buttons and devices. Also, very limited external devices can be used to add on to the already existing game features, although it does allow for four player options through direct link cables. WWE Survivor Series and WWF Road to WrestleMania were the only other versions of the WWE games developed by Natsume for the GBA and earned only average reviews from the gaming world. WWE Road to WrestleMania X8 was the most successful out of the three games in regard to both sales and reviews.</p>"
