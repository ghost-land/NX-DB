It was initially released for the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron in 1989 as part of Superior/Acornsoft's Play It Again Sam 10 compilation. An updated and enhanced Amiga version was given a budget release by Team17 in 1993. This update added several new features, including a two player mode and additional levels. The game was re-released on the Amiga CD32 later that year in a double-pack with science fiction shooter Alien Breed.</p>\n<p>In 2006, Woodhouse completed development of a Game Boy Advance version of Qwak. .
