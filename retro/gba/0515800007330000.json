Both modes have the same core gameplay mechanics.</p>\n<p>The players are to shoot everything they spot on the screen. The more enemies you kill, the more points you get. A point multiplier system is present in the game. To activate the score multiplier, the players have to pick up two numbers that randomly spawn on the battlefield. After doing that their sum appears at the top of the screen and the player is prompted to choose one of three answers. If the player answers correctly, the multiplier is increased and is decreased otherwise. To achieve the highest score, it is essential to get the highest point multiplier.</p>\n<p>Arcade mode is a default game mode. The players are given three lives and have to get as far as possible before they spend all their lives. After killing the Twin Hornets, the players are given one additional life.</p>\n<p>In Time Attack, the players have to deal the most damage possible before the time runs out. The players are awarded more time by solving a simple math problem.</p>\n<p>There are six levels in the game. A boss is present at the end of each level, and several mini-bosses can be met during the gameplay.</p>"
