    "description": "<p>Double Dragon III: The Sacred Stones, released in Japan as Double Dragon III: The Rosetta Stone (\u30c0\u30d6\u30eb\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30f3\u2162\u3000\u30b6\u30fb\u30ed\u30bc\u30c3\u30bf\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3), is a side-scrolling beat-'em-up produced for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1991. It was the third Double Dragon game for the NES, developed by Technos Japan Corp. and published in North America and Europe by Acclaim Entertainment. Although loosely based on the similarly titled arcade game Double Dragon 3: The Rosetta Stone, it is not a port, but rather a parallel project that was developed at the same time.</p>"
