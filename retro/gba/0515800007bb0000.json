    "description": "After committing honorable sepuku Turtle finds himself in hell.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nTurtle is compelled in death to do what he loved most when he was alive: Race. But, he needs the minds of hell's other denizens to do so. As he explores their minds one question seems to permeate, \"Why would anyone choose hell over heaven?\"<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe objective of this dialogue heavy philosophical platformer/runner is to reach a goal speed by avoiding and bouncing off of obstacles by using a grapple-based movement system. There are only three buttons, up, down, and pull/push. Small mistakes are fine as there is no restarting or death since it's your average recent speed that matters. Instead players should find themselves entering a zen-like flow as they attempt to achieve maximum velocity.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nHorrible graphics I know, but I promise the story is great and the gameplay is fun."
