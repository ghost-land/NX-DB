    "description": "<p>Ace Combat Advance is a video game in the Ace Combat series. It is the first in the series for a handheld gaming system. Unlike other flight simulators, it's a top-down shooter similar to Strike (video game series), but using fighter jets. It has been criticized for awkward controls, lack of appeal, difficulty and very poor graphics. Unlike other Ace Combat games, a Japanese release for the title was absent.</p>"
