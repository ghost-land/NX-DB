    "description": "<p>Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots is a fighting video game developed by Full Fat and published by Zoo Digital in 2006 for the Game Boy Advance. The game is based heavily on the 1964 toy of the same name, and involves the player taking control of a brightly coloured plastic robot and engaging in close combat with an opposing robot. The first robot to inflict enough damage to cause his opponent's head to pop up is declared the winner. The game is notable for garnering significant negative criticism for its gameplay mechanics and inherent lack of difficulty, poor-quality visuals and repetitive 'button-mashing' gameplay. Chris Adams of gaming website IGN said in his review of the title that 'it is the single worst game I've ever played on the Game Boy Advance'.</p>"
