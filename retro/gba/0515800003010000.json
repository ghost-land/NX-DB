    "description": "<p>Gekido Advance: Kintaro&#39;s Revenge is a beat &#39;em up game for the Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo Switch. It is a sequel to the game Gekido.<br />\nUnlike the previous installment, this game centers on one protagonist, instead of multiple characters as seen in Gekido.<br />\nThe game focuses on Tetsuo, who has returned to his sensei&#39;s house only to be dispatched to a remote farming village where it seems as if the dead rise from the grave. Upon further investigation, Tetsuo finds out that the village has been having strange happenings ever since the old temple became overrun with demons. When he returns to the village after talking to the old guardian of the Temple, the village has been attacked, supposedly, as one of the dying villagers says, by &quot;...ravens...&quot; Also, it seems as if all the children have vanished as well.</p>"
