    "description": "<p>Lady Sia is a platform game with action-adventure elements made by RFX Interactive for the Game Boy Advance. It was published by TDK Mediactive, released in the USA on October 15, 2001, and released in Europe on October 19, 2001. Lady Sia is one of the few original games produced by RFX Interactive. The game takes place in a fantasy world where the player assumes the role of the Xena-esque warrior princess, Lady Sia. It is her task to defeat the T'soas, a race of anthropomorphs created by the evil warlock Onimen who has declared war on the other realms. Her quest leads her through four different realms, the last one being the home continent of the T'soas themselves. A sequel was planned for the GBA in 2003 but was cancelled due to lack of interest and funding.</p>"
