    "description": "<p>Lufia: The Ruins of Lore, known in Japan as Chinmoku no Iseki: Estpolis Gaiden (\u6c88\u9ed9\u306e\u907a\u8de1 \uff5e\u30a8\u30b9\u30c8\u30dd\u30ea\u30b9\u5916\u4f1d\uff5e), is a role-playing video game developed by Atelier Double and published by Taito in Japan in 2002 and by Atlus a year later in North America. It is the fourth title in the Lufia series of video games and was released as a \"gaiden\", or side story, to the main series; as a result, it does not feature many elements common to the rest of the series, such as the Sinistrals and the Dual Blade.</p>"
