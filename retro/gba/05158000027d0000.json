    "description": "<p>FIFA 2002 is here, and is packed with features sure to make all gamers and soccer fans happy. With all-new open passing, you have more control and precision than ever before. Find a breaking forward with a perfect 40-yard ball into open space, embarrass the tightest defense with cunning one-twos, or fool any keeper with deep-swerving crosses. With deeper customization, FIFA 2002 is set to dominate the competition.</p>\n<p>All-new tackling and referee models let players angle and time tackle to determine success (or get a potential card from the referee). Cinematic cutscenes seamlessly capture all the impact, pain, and emotion of a world-class game. Hardcore in-game animations capture the rough-and-tumble aspects of soccer with increased physical contact, giant collisions, and crunching falls. Authentic light sourcing delivers dynamic player shading and accentuated physical detail as players pass in and out of shadows.</p>\n<p>FIFA 2002 gives players the choice of more than 75 licensed national teams and 16 licensed leagues, including the English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish Premier League, the French LNF, and Major League Soccer. Localized commentary is provided by legendary commentator John Motson and renowned soccer star Andy Gray.</p>"
