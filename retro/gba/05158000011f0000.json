Car Battler Go!!) is a car battling video game for the Game Boy Advance, developed by Ancient and published by Natsume. The game involves using cars to fight opponents in action-styled battles, with role-playing video game game mechanics. It combined vehicular combat with action RPG elements in a similar manner to the earlier 1985 game Autoduel based on Car Wars, and later 2006 MMO game Auto Assault.</p>"
