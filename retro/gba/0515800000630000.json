    "description": "Altered Beast: Guardian of the Realms is a side-scrolling action game in which you play as a dead guy who's been resurrected by Zeus for the purpose of rescuing the realms from an evil monster named Arcanon. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nThere are 15 different realms to visit, and your job is to make your way past the dozens of monsters in each one in order to battle and defeat the boss creature waiting at the end of the level. Your attacks include a variety of kicks and punches, and you can jump or duck to avoid nearby enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nOne addition to this successor is the inclusion of attack items that you can gather throughout each level that offer all sorts of useful abilities, such as regeneration, increased speed, and shields.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nUsing a link cable, you can battle your friends with the creatures you collect in the story mode."
