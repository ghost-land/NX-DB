    "description": "<p>Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge, known in Japan as Rockman EXE Battle Chip GP (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc \u30d0\u30c8\u30eb\u30c1\u30c3\u30d7GP), is a video game developed by Inti Creates and published by Capcom for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld game console. It is a spin-off title in the Mega Man Battle Network series. The game saw a simultaneous August 8, 2003 release in Japan on the WonderSwan Color and Swan Crystal titled Rockman EXE N1 Battle (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3\u30a8\u30b0\u30bc N1\u30d0\u30c8\u30eb). The GBA version was localized in North America and Europe the following March. It was released on the Wii U&#39;s Virtual Console on July 30, 2014 in Japan, with both the North American and PAL region release occurring in August 2014.<br />\nTaking place within the timeline of the Battle Network series, Battle Chip Challenge involves a battling tournament called the &quot;Battle Chip GP&quot; among various pairs of online avatars called &quot;NetNavis&quot; and their human operators. Rather than directly control the player character through the traditional real-time tactical role-playing battles of the other Battle Network games, Battle Chip Challenge tasks the player with creating a &quot;Program Deck&quot; made up of abilities called &quot;Battle Chips&quot;. The game randomly selects chips for the player and executes them in a duel with a computer-controlled opponent. Battle Chip Challenge suffered a relatively negative critical reception.</p>"
