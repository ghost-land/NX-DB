Rool has stolen the medals to be used in the Jungle Jam<br />\nTournament just as the festivities are ramping up, putting a damper to<br />\neveryone&#39;s good spirits. With Cranky&#39;s blessing and techniques, Donkey<br />\nKong sets off to bring those medals back to their rightful place!</p>\n<p>Grab, climb, and swing on pegs as you charge and bash through enemies<br />\nthat block your way. Collect bananas and Crystal Coconuts in the five<br />\nworlds of Adventure mode, or play some puzzling levels in Single-player<br />\nJungle Jam mode. Find those medals, and let the festivities begin!<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
