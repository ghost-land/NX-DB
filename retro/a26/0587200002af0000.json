    "description": "This game is simple to play easy to run and completely free no adds or in game purchases involved it is Endless Void studios first large project and as such we wanted to make it our gift to you . We may expand it in the future to have multiplayer and other options but for now it is in a basic campaign focused mode . That being said its main feature is its massive 5 Act campaign and detailed open world system designed to allow for all of this content to run smoothly on your machine. games are fully savable and old saves will work with new versions of the game but the game allows only one saved file to be stored at a time to give it part of the retro feel we wanted for this title."
