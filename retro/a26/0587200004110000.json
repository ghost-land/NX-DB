    "description": "<p>WIP!!! This game doesn't work yet on itch.io and we're making some finishing touches, but if you wanna play it in its unfinished state, head on over to\u00a0subsim.io.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Welcome to Sub Sub Sub 2:\u00a0Sub Sub Sub Sub, a realistic stealth simulation game where staying undetected is quite literally, a matter of degree.\u00a0The year is 2030. The United States is a shattered mess, and every Seattle hipster's dream has come true. Cascadia. It's a reality now. Complicating things for the new republic, the former United States has stationed a Virginia class submarine in the Puget Sound to block incoming shipments of supplies. The rebels have managed to secure SSN-22, a Seawolf class submarine of their own. Unfortunately, nobody really knows how to pilot it so everyone's just making it up as they go along.</p>\n<p>Take on the role of captain and break the blockade, or you can be evil and take control of the Virginia class sub, I\u00a0guess.</p>\n<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>\n<p>Sub Sub Sub Sub is a PvP multiplayer game, so grab a friend and enter the same game code to see who's better at figuring out how to read sonar. Play on itch.io or grab the latest version at subsim.io.</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0Ellen Poe worked on the backend stuff and got sonar simulation working. Evin Sellin did all kinds of cool frontend stuff.</p>"
