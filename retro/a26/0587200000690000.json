Uses assets from River City Ransom but i have no intention to sell this.\u00a0 Controls: Ctrl to punch, arrows to move, space to jump, shift to grab and P to pause ( how to use the rpg stats). Intel has no use, Strength increases damage and throw distance and lift strength, agility increases move speed and jump height.</p>"
