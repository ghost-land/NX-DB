    "description": "<p>GOO-ROO is a 2-D pixel art puzzle platformer that takes an alternative approach to jumping and\u00a0resource management.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Play as little Roo, a tiny and hungry Goo on a journey to eat magical beans.\u00a0Roo hops around with ease, but bigger jumps require Roo to fling itself higher, which leaves behind a part of its body. Luckily, Roo isn't a very picky eater - it\u00a0can and will eat all <em>GREEN</em> things it comes into contact with (including its own remains).\u00a0</p>\n<p>GOO-ROO tests both player's mechanical skills and strategy. Challenge yourself and your friends to\u00a0complete all of the levels!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<p>-\u00a0Bounce around 8 different levels <strong>PLUS</strong> an additional secret boss level\u00a0(!)</p>\n<p>- Enjoy an original soundtrack featuring 4 different tracks</p>\n\n<p><em>(Currently Windows only - Mac build potentially coming out soon!)</em></p>"
