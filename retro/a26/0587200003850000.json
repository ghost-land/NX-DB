    "description": "<p>Skeet Shoot is a skeet shooting video game for the Atari 2600 and the first game released by Games by Apollo. Players assume the role of a skeet shooter shooting clay pigeons. There is a two-player mode where the players alternate. It was developed by programmer Ed Salvo in his Iowa home and purchased by Pat Roper for release in December 1981 under the newly formed Apollo. Despite negative reviews, it was a financial success, and led to Salvo's continuation with the company, where he became Director of Development.</p>"
