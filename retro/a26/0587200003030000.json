    "description": "<p>I created this game several years ago, as a volunteer for a nature center. The plan was that it would be set up on a touchscreen computer in the lobby of the nature center for visitors to play and maybe create some teachable moments. Sadly that never came to be. So I'm uploading it here for posterity. <br/></p>\n<p>This game was written directly in JavaScript, using the HTML5 Canvas. <br/></p>"
