    "description": "<p>This is a fan PC remake of Answer Software's Atari 2600 game <em>Malagai.\u00a0</em>We had released <em>Malagai Legends</em> at Atari Age (https://www.atariage.com/) in 2003 to commemorate the game's 20th Anniversary, and it received a moderate response (for what it was). We are not the original creators, but rather a couple of fans who\u00a0paid tribute to an underrated classic.</p>\n<p>This game contains the original <em>Malagai Legends</em> game as an executable (.exe) file and a manual.
