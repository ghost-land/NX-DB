    "description": "<p><strong>There are stories about that old luna park...</strong><br/>Have you ever wondered what\u2019s inside that old abandoned luna park? I hope you haven\u2019t, because it\u2019s not safe to even think of some places. But if you asked yourself, even once, the answer is closer than you can imagine! At night when carousels start spinning and loudspeakers start playing spooky music... you may hear laughs and gunshots coming from the tent in the centre of the park. It\u2019s the main attraction - the legendary shooting gallery and all these sounds mean only one thing - someone is fighting to save their soul.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shoot for the moon... literally!</strong><br/>You know how to use a gun right? Let\u2019s hope you do. Be prepared to face threats that have been left by mad owners of this place for too curious people like you. You might beat them, but your shooting skills will be put to the ultimate test - be ready to meet\u2026 well, you\u2019ll see for yourself!
