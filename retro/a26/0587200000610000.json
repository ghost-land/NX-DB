    "description": "Have you ever wanted to crush robots in an inflatable ball? To be a spaceship blasting debris? Or even, scandalously, be legally allowed to throw a basketball? You can do all these things <strong>and more</strong> from the comfort of your very own home with your brand new copy of <strong>Basketball</strong> by Kitsch Digital, developers of Dropping Into Work and hosts of SCREAM ZONE game jams.<br/><br/><br/><br/>You play as a kid who just wanted to spend the holidays hanging out with his friends, but whose father had other ideas. Whisked away on a tropical island getaway, you're left to kill time in the hotel's relaxation zone.<h3>Short But Sweet</h3>This game is <strong>only 20-30 minutes long</strong>! Don't say we didn't warn you.<h3>Have Fun With Physics</h3>Throw basketballs at people! And also targets, hoops, and objectives I guess - but you can absolutely throw them at people.<h3>Exciting Minigames</h3>As if basketball wasn't enough, there are also other things!<h3>Dark Undertones</h3>What really is \"virtual reality\"? Is it dangerous and, crucially, can I eat it? All valid questions you'll learn the answers to while playing.<h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>Play a neat story-driven game.<br/></li><li>Experience 20-30 minutes of simple, fun gameplay.<br/></li><li>Play with a controller OR a keyboard! (We don't accept mice here)<br/></li><li>Engage cool minigames slotted into the flow of the game.<br/></li><li>Discover the answer to what \"virtual reality\" really is (and if it's good on toast).</li></ul><br/>"
