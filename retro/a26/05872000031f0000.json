Try to help a little memory cell making its way to the Nullbyte of the RAM to defend a virus. There are lots of hidden platforms...\u00a0</p>\n<p>... which are suddenly appearing step by step if you fell\u00a0off...</p>\n<p><strong>It took so much work to do this game and I hope you enjoy. If so I would be glad about some feedback ;)\u00a0</strong></p>"
