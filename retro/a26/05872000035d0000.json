But during your wayfaring swashbuckling adventures, you have taken on some very large holes in your hull. Impending doom shadows over you as anvils continuously fall from the heavens weighing you down closer to a watery death. It is up to you to help Shippy repair these holes and get Shippy home!</p>\n<p>Credits:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Paul Barbato: Art &amp; Animation</p>\n<p>pauljamesbarbato.com</p>\n<p>Steven Huang: Music</p>\n<p>stevencharleshuang.com</p>\n<p>Tim Kafalas: Software Engineer</p>\n<p>timkaf.com</p>"
