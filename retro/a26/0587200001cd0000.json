    "description": "<p>In Driver, you are the wheelman in a series of Hollywood-style car-chases. A great getaway driver is only as good as his equipment, which is why Driver has a selection of performance-packed muscle cars, complete with realistic handling, damage modeling, and real-world physics reactions. Driver also comes fully equipped with a replay/director mode that gives you all the necessary tools to &quot;film&quot; their own car chase and multiple views that allow you to look around when you&#39;re driving. Put the pedal to the metal and be the best driver around.</p>"
