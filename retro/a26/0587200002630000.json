    "description": "<p>MINOS is a game developed for the Game Boy. I fished it out of an ice lake.</p>\n<p>THE PRINCE HAS BEEN LOCKED IN THE LABYRINTH BY HIS WICKED FATHER!</p>\n<p>Navigate through the maze, collect drachma, and save your BOYFRIEND!</p>\n<p>Be careful; for when the lights go out, the disembodied head of the Minotaur haunts the maze (maybe it\u2019s just a bull\u2019s head?)! Light the torches and choose your path WISELY!</p>\n<p>Slightly water damaged.</p>"
