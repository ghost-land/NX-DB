    "description": "<p>Confrontation is the TRPG and the video game adaptation of the tabletop title of the same name by Rackham. That is the only title in the IP, and the game is developed by Cyanide. This studio is also famous for the Pro Cycling Manager series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The narrative in the game is presented via short briefings given to the player before the missions. The events depicted in the game cannot vary \u2014 the game is highly linear. The whole story circles around the constant fights of the protagonist team with no motivation for them provided whatsoever. All of the playable characters remain silent most of the time during the gameplay process.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The video game adopts a plot from the tabletop wargaming. The setting is shared between two titles \u2014 it is the stylized medieval world called Aarklash which is constantly torn down by some races typical of role-playing games: wizards, knights, and priests. There are many outcomes to the game while it is unknown which fraction prevails. <br />\nThe video game adaptation inherits the world and builds an adventure around the team of heroes composed out of 4 characters chosen by the player. This team travels through levels, guiding each other through the enemies, traps, and puzzles along the way. The game does not feature any NPC&#39;s to talk with and complex puzzles to solve \u2014 any riddle works according to mechanics &quot;pull the lever \u2014 open the door.</p>"
