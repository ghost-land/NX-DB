    "description": "<p><strong>A Steam-Key is provided with every purchase of the game on itch.io.</strong></p>\n<p>OneJump is a minimalistic highscore based jump game. The challenging factor: you only have one chance to jump.<br/>If you fall or get hit by an evil block, you will have to start again. It also gets increasingly harder as you progress.<br/>You can also play against a friend in splitscreen to find out who of you has better skills. Play either 1, 2 or 5 minutes and choose if you want to win based on the score or the level you reach. In the local multiplayer a mistake will result in your score getting halved.</p>\n<p><strong>Features:</strong></p>\n<ul><li>Endless Mode<br/>\n</li><li>Tutorial<br/>\n</li><li>Local Multiplayer (for two players)<br/>\n</li><li>Steam Leaderboard (only available in the Steam-Version)<br/>\n</li><li>Steam Achievements (only available in the Steam-Version)<br/>\n</li><li>Steam Cloud Save\u00a0(only available in the Steam-Version)</li></ul>\n\n\n<p><strong>Please note that, although the game is DRM-free, the Steam-Features are not available if the game is started from outside of Steam for obvious reasons.</strong><br/><br/>This game is my first publication on Steam. After the completion of this game, I aim to build a more complex project. I really hope you enjoy this little game. Please report any bugs you may encounter so that I can fix them. There shouldn't be many, but as I mentioned, it's really my first game on Steam. Any feedback appreciated.<br/><br/>Have fun!</p>"
