    "description": "Remember the GAMMA BROS?  If you do, you're probably old like Pixeljam.  If you don't, then welcome aboard! This is the game that solidified Pixeljam's resolve to be the best damn pixel-wielding indie game company we could be, and we're on a mission to MAKE THE SOLAR SYSTEM GREAT AGAIN.<br/><br/>The Gamma Bros are the hardest working mixed-race twin brothers of the near future, and they are about to embark on a commute of epic proportions...<br/><br/><br/>THE ORIGINAL STORY<br/><br/>The Gamma Brothers spend their days working on a huge space station near Jupiter.  No one works harder than the Gamma Brothers. What could they possibly be working on? Something very important, no doubt.<br/><br/>The Gamma Brothers also understand the importance of not working.  Every day at quitting time they hop into their commuter vehicles for the long, difficult journey back to earth.  Every day on their way home, they are attacked by ships and creatures of unknown origin. Every day, to and from work, they must survive many vicious and clever alien attacks! <br/><br/>It is up to YOU to guide the Gamma Brothers home.  Prepare yourself for the ultimate space commute battle!  After all, it is dinner time on earth, and the Gamma Brothers' families will not be pleased if you don't get Buzz and Zap home safely.<br/><br/><br/>THE PLAN<br/><br/>We're releasing Gamma Bros on Early Access as VERSION 1.0.  Watch us magically transform the game into VERSION 1.5, with all new weapons, bosses, playable characters and more.   Track our progress through a deliciously transparent ROADMAP on our site at http://pixeljam.com/gammabros.  <br/><br/>FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION!  For us, and the Bros.  Help them get home in time for dinner, and help us make the game better than it's ever been before...."
