    "description": "PICNIC is a 3 dimensional labyrinth game. And this 3 dimensions are not only spatial: The first dimension is the visual dimension, a surreal digital labyrinth in which the user is awaking in the middle of a nightmare. Far away is a kind of bright green plastic hill, this seems to be, close to a strange phony star, the only colorful thing in the monochrome game world. On a wall is something written, inviting the user to go to the green hill, to the \"picnic hill\". On another wall: The user should listen carefully, THEY will show him/her the way. If the user is \"listening carefully\", THEY will \"show you the way\". And actually, if the user is searching a way through the visual labyrinth, THEY appear and THEY are telling something... It seems to be a story... about someone, who is planning to make (the game) picnic or even to have a picnic, but something happens... maybe something very scary... So the second dimension is the story labyrinth.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhile searching a way through the labyrinth and \"listen carefully\", what THEY say - the user will \"rewrite\" or de-construct (depending on the ways the user is choosing) a story... But this story is again a labyrinth, a text labyrinth... <br/>\n<br/>\r\nWhich could be a novel, called PICNIC - depending on choices and how willing the user is \"to listen carefully\" - and also depending on the third dimension of the labyrinth: the noise labyrinth. Because if the user is not willing to \"listen carefully\", the novel PICNIC, meaning what the \"creatures\" are saying, is turning into inarticulate sound up to industrial-like harsh noise (depending on the game play of the user).<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\"Picnic\"-novel: (C) 1999 A.D.
