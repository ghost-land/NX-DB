    "description": "<p>Baseball (Japanese: \u30d9\u30fc\u30b9\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb, Hepburn: B\u0113sub\u014dru) is a 1983 video game from Nintendo, one of the first early titles for the Family Computer. In 1985, the game was featured prominently amongst the 18 titles at the Manhattan test market launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System, being demonstrated on a large projector screen by real Major League Baseball players. The game's launch position and the universal appeal of its namesake sport are said to have made Baseball a key to the NES's overall success, and an important piece of Nintendo history.</p>"
