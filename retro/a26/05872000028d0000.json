Hope that makes sense LOL.<br/>I wanna thank my brothers Ulises and Emilio for helping me out with the game idea and play testing the first builds.\u00a0</p><p>I\u00a0had a lot of fun in this jam, and this is the very first jam where I\u00a0can finish a project! (thanks Extra Credits for making it 4 days long). Can't wait for signing up to a next game jam!<br/><br/>If you loved it or you hated it please leave a comment with your thoughs.
