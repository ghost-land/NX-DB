    "description": "Survival Run\r\n<p>Survival Run is a platformer game, that is set in a dystopian future. The human race is gone and has left mutated plants and oiled birds in their wake. Can you help the fox reach its forest home safely or will you \u00a0meet a dangerous end.</p>\n<p>This game has been made with on-screen buttons that help control the player.</p>\n<p>It is has been designed for children with a heavy theme of nature, and includes an info page with some facts and a link to the WWF website.</p>\n<p>This is my first game I have made, so it's not too great, but I would welcome any helpful criticism or feedback.</p>\n<p>I hope you enjoy.</p>"
