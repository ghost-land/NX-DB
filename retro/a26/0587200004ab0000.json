    "description": "<p>Wings is a World War I video game developed and published by Cinemaware that was originally released for the Amiga in 1990 and was later ported to the Game Boy Advance as Wings Advance in 2002. It is similar to the action sequences of the 1927 silent film Wings, but the story shown before each mission is different from the plot of the movie. The original Wings is considered by some as one of the best games in Amiga&#39;s history. Its remake titled Wings! Remastered was released in 2014 and 2015 for the Windows, MacOS, Android and iOS platforms.</p>"
