Jungle Hunt is one of the first video games to use parallax scrolling.<br />\nThe player controls an unnamed explorer, sporting a pith helmet and safari suit, attempting to rescue his girl from a tribe of cannibals by swinging from vine to vine, swimming a crocodile-infested river, and avoiding rolling rocks. Taito released a re-skinned version of the game as Pirate Pete.<br />\nAtari published home ports under their own brand for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, and Atari 8-bit family. The rest were released under the Atarisoft label: Apple II, ColecoVision, Commodore 64, VIC-20, IBM PC (as a PC booter), and TI-99/4A.
