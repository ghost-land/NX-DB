    "description": "In this game there are six riders racing for the finish line and along the track have to clear a number of diverse fences,  ditches and other obstacles. From the settings, you may pick your horse, the speed of the game, and the distance of the race. To control your horse, swipe up on the screen to jump and swipe right to accelerate. Failure to clear an obstacle will dismount you off the horse and game over;  except when the obstacle is a roll of hay, which will slow but not dismount you. Click on (?) to demo the game."
