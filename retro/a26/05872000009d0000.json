    "description": "<p>D\u00e9sir\u00e9 is a poetic point-and-click adventure game in black and white.<br />\nWhen the schoolteacher asks D\u00e9sir\u00e9 why he didn&#39;t draw the sun like the other pupils, he replies spontaneously: \u00ab It&#39;s always night in my head. \u00bb<br />\nD\u00e9sir\u00e9 is colour-blind from birth and he will lead you into in world of black and white. He marches on hesitantly, as life never brought him much joy. From a tender age, he is going to meet several characters who will elicit in D\u00e9sir\u00e9 intense emotions and alter his vision in surprising ways. Is colour at the end of the road?<br />\nThe game is, at its core, a critique of the modern world and of the perverting nature of a consumer, profit-obsessed society.<br />\nThe game contains 4 chapters, 50+ scenes, 40+ characters and a lot of riddles.<br />\nSome material may be inappropriate for under 16.</p>"
