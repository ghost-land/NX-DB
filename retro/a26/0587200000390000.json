    "description": "<p>Aquaventure 2.0 is a remake of the classic game Aquaventure for the Atari 2600. This was a project I received in my first year in college with the aim to remake the game and put my own unique spin on it. I enjoyed making this game, especially the sprites so I hope you receive some the joy playing it that I did making it. The entire game was made in Gamemaker and I created all the sprites using Pixen. I'd appreciate it if you could leave some feedback if you enjoyed the game and same again if you didn't. Thanks for playing, I really appreciate it!</p>"
