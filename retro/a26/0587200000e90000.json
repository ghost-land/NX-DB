    "description": "<p>\r\n\tA fast paced space shooter, which gets significantly harder every wave. Pickups, spaceships and fireballs randomly spawn around you while you try to stay alive. This game can be played in short sessions, but to finish the game you'll have to practice (and die) a lot!\r\n</p><p>\r\n\tEvery wave introduces a new layer to the music, and only if you make it to the last wave you'll hear the full soundtrack in all it's glory!</p>"
