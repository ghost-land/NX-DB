    "description": "<strong>Cubicolor</strong> is a minimalist puzzle game with soothing piano music.<br/><br/>The rules are simple: Match the color patches on the board and reach the exit, all on one single path. Every tile can only be touched once before it falls into nothingness. The game features 50 different levels and gets harder as you progress, always accompanying you with relaxing piano tunes."
