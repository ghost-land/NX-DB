    "description": "A 3D isometric top-down dieselpunk-inspired, roguelike game. The world of Turmoil is set in an alternate history where humans developed machines that run on oil to automate society. Eventually, machines began making more machines to boost productivity while safety was disregarded. As the last human left in the esteemed factory of Geargrave Automations, Harry suffers a life-threatening injury to the only thing keeping him a valuable asset to the company. Now, with an injured mechanical arm leaking oil, sitting in the trash, Harry realizes he won't survive unless he fights. He must rise from the ashes, learning how to survive with nothing but his leaking arm and a general knowledge of mechanics. His goal is to avenge the humans who were disposed of in the past by defeating the boss, Kornelius Rayburn Geargrave, and shutting down the factory. Geargrave only values efficiency, output, and profit, so when hearing of Harry's retaliation, all robots are set to go hostile when in the presence of deviant employees. <br/>\n<br/>\r\nNavigate through three different procedurally generated levels of the factory, fighting hostile robots for survival, collecting their oil to continue forward as there is no choice but to persist. Collect blueprints and scrap around the factory to upgrade Harry's mechanical arm. Collect oil canisters to keep him alive and utilize the hazardous environment to defeat attacking robots. Rise from the ashes! Show the boss that a worker is more than their mechanical parts."
