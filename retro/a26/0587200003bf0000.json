    "description": "<p>Space Tunnel 2 (made in Gamemaker 8) is one of my oldest games I ever made. Back in 2009 I wanted to create a really simple and straightforward game without fancy graphics.</p>\n<p>In 2012 I reworked the game with a lot of extras and this year I added some new elements like a more sensitive keyboard control as well as gamepad support and many more improvements.</p>\n<p>The reason I think the game works is because the extremely simple game principle goes hand in hand with the blocky aesthetics and midi music in a way that motivates the player to always push forward, just. one. more. time, without distracting elements, merely focusing on the fast-paced and progressive gameplay.</p>\n<p>Players have the choice to keep their scores offline or to upload their runs onto an online leaderboard, powered by gmscoreboard.com.</p>\n<p>Space Tunnel 2: Easy to learn, extremely hard to master!</p>\n<p>Good luck and skill!<br/></p>"
