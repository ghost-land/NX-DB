    "description": "Your father was a true fisherman, committed to his profession. Now you have grown up and it's time for you to carry on his hard work. The world has changed however, and all the fish who formerly lived here, have long ago abandoned this place.<br/><br/>The full moon is a time when evil wakes up and strange things begin to happen.<br/><br/>And only at this time do the fish come back, as well as those creatures that once lived here. Take your father's ship and go ahead, but remember \u2013 you are not the only one on the hunt.<br/><br/><ul><li> Catch fish to then sell it in the bay.<br/></li><li> Defend yourself from the ghosts of dead pirates.<br/></li><li> Repair a ship from damages inflicted by the drowned.<br/></li><li> Protect your spoils from pesky aliens.<br/></li><li> Buy enhancements for money earned from fish sales.</li></ul><br/>Reach the \"Red Moon\" day, and prove that you deserve to step into your father's shoes."
