    "description": "<p>Cosmic Ark is an Atari 2600 game designed by Rob Fulop and published by Imagic in 1982. The game is loosely connected with Imagic's Atlantis, in that the same small spacecraft appears in both games. The objective is to gather specimens from different planets in a spaceship which contains the survivors from the city of Atlantis.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the cartridge. One allows the player to toggle the starfield display with the Black &amp; White / Color TV switch. In the other the starfield cannot be disabled.</p>"
