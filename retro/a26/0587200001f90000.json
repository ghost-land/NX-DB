    "description": "<p>Jr. Pac-Man is an arcade game, released by Bally Midway on January 1, 1983. It is based on Pac-Man and its derivatives but, like Ms. Pac-Man, Baby Pac-Man, and Pac-Man Plus, was created without the authorization of Namco. This was one of several games that would eventually lead to the termination of the licensing agreement between Namco and Bally Midway in 1984.</p>"
