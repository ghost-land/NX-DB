    "description": "Hello Professor Watts here and I have some research to do on memory skills.  I have assembled a wide variety of shapes and colors to put our memory to the test.  We can see how we're doing by completing matches in a specific amount of time and earning points to track our overall progress.  It would really help having someone sharp like yourself on my team to complete this research.  Complete 80 challenging randomized memory match puzzles and aim for a new top score each time you play."
