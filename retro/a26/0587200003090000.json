    "description": "<p>Quadrun is a video game for the Atari 2600 developed by Steve Woita and published in 1983 by Atari, Inc.. One of the four Atari Club games available exclusively via mail order, this title may have been available later in stores in very limited quantities. This is one of the rarest games from Atari, as only approximately 10,000 were initially made. Quadrun is the first Atari 2600 game to feature voice synthesis (\"Quadrun! Quadrun! Quadrun!\"); the only other is Open Sesame, made by Bit Corp.</p>"
