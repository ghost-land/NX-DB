    "description": "<p>Mouse Trap is a 1981 arcade maze game developed by Exidy. The game design is similar to Pac-Man, replacing Pac-Man with a mouse, the dots with cheese, the ghosts with cats, and the power pills with bones. The unique element of Mouse Trap is that color-coded doors in the maze can be toggled by pressing a button of the same color.</p>\n<p>The game was ported by Coleco as a ColecoVision launch title in 1982, then later to the Intellivision and Atari 2600.</p>"
