    "description": "<p>Night Driver is an arcade game developed by Atari Inc for release in the United States in October, 1976. It was inspired by the earlier German coin-op N\u00fcrburgring 1. Along with Micronetics' Night Racer and Midway's 280 ZZZAP, Night Driver is one of the earliest first-person racing video games, and is commonly believed to be one of the first published games to display real-time first-person graphics.</p>"
