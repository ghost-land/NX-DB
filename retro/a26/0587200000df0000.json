    "description": "<p>Congo Bongo (\u30b3\u30f3\u30b4\u30dc\u30f3\u30b4, Kongo Bongo), also known as Tip Top (\u30c6\u30a3\u30c3\u30d7\u30bf\u30c3\u30d7, Tippu Tappu), is an isometric platform arcade game released by Sega in 1983. The player takes the role of a red-nosed safari hunter who tries to catch an ape named Bongo. The hunter seeks Bongo to exact revenge for an apparent practical joke in which Bongo set fire to the hunter's tent, giving him a literal \"hot foot.\" The game was named by Peter W. Gorrie who was the CFO of Sega at that time.</p>\n<p>The game's ROM contains a message indicating it was likely coded at least in part by the company Ikegami Tsushinki.</p>"
