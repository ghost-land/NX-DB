    "description": "<p>Chopper Command is a video game by Activision released for the Atari 2600 in June 1982. It was designed and programmed by Bob Whitehead. One reviewer referred to it as &quot;Defender in the desert&quot;.<br />\nIn Chopper Command the player controls a military helicopter in a desert scenario protecting a convoy of trucks. The goal is to destroy all enemy fighter jets and helicopters that attack the player&#39;s helicopter and the friendly trucks traveling below, ending the current wave. The game ends when the player loses all of his or her lives or reaches 999,999 points. A radar, called a Long Range Scanner in the instruction manual, shows all enemies, including those not visible on the main screen.<br />\nA player who achieved 10,000 points could send in a photo of the TV screen and receive a &quot;Chopper Commandos&quot; patch.</p>"
