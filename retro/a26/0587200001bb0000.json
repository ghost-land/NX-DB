    "description": "<p>Guardian is a 3D shoot 'em up video game. It was originally released in 1994 for the Commodore Amiga CD32 game console, and later converted to the Amiga 1200 on floppy disk. Originally previewed in the press under the name SibWing and apparently an homage to the Super NES game Star Fox, the final game was an accomplished three-dimensional update of the classic arcade game Defender.</p>\n<p>Guardian is known to be one of the very few Amiga CD32 games to be apparently programmed for the CD32 first and then ported in stripped-down form to the Amiga computers\u2014the vast majority of CD32 software releases were little more than standard Amiga games with minimum, if any, enhancements.</p>\n<p>Guardian was particularly lauded by the popular games magazine Amiga Power. In the penultimate issue of the publication in August 1996, Guardian was rated the third best Amiga game ever in a Top 100 feature compiled by Amiga Power staff past and present.</p>"
