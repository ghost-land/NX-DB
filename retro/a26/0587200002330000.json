    "description": "<p><strong>M.A.D.</strong>, a game inspired by Lieutenant Colonel Stanislav Petrov who saved the world on 26 September, 1983. As the tensions between The United States and Soviet Union\u00a0reached a climax, a faulty early warning system which told of\u00a0ICBM's inbound for Soviet land\u00a0left the fate of the world in one man's hands. The warning can't be true, you know that if the U.S. were to attack they would used all their might in one mass of force attack... but good luck telling that to your trigger happy superiors that. Run the diagnostics, compile the data, and submit your report before leadership decides to fire back. Prevent mutually assured destruction.</p>\n<p>Credits:</p>\n<p>Various beeps:\u00a0https://www.zapsplat.com/<br/></p>\n<p>Other beeps: created with beepbox.co</p>\n<p>Music:\u00a0</p>\n<p>Programmers: Brian (Tuna), Wes (Flook)</p>\n\n<p>Artists:\u00a0Brian (Tuna), Wes (Flook)</p>"
