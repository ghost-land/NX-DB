When a roboticist from the University of Iox goes missing, Aliya begins a trail of discoveries that will lead to the very edge of her world - and the ancient secret of Heaven&#39;s Vault.<br />\nSail an open-world of fast flowing space-rivers, discover lost ruins, explore ancient sites, find artefacts and translate their strange hieroglyphics. Piece together the history of the world and an entire alien language.<br />\nFrom the creators of massively-branching interactive adventure 80 Days, Heaven&#39;s Vault is not your usual linear adventure game. Progress through the game in any order you choose - the game&#39;s fully adaptive narrative remembers every choice you make, every discovery and every action you take, influencing what happens next. Meet a diverse cast of characters who remember everything you say, and who&#39;s attitude to you will change with how you act. Some are friendly, some are cautious, and some are out to trick you.<br />\nWho will you trust? What will you find? What will you learn? What will you risk? What will you lose?</p>"
