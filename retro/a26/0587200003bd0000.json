    "description": "<p>Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space is a space flight simulator game designed by Steve Kitchen for the Atari 2600 and published by Activision in 1983. It is one of the first realistic spacecraft simulations available for home systems. Space Shuttle was adapted to the Atari 8-bit family and Atari 5200 by Bob Henderson (1984), then ported to the ZX Spectrum (1984), Commodore 64 (1984), Amstrad CPC (1986), and MSX (1986). The 1984 Activision Software catalog also mentions an Apple II version.</p>\n<p>The player controls the most critical flight phases such as Launch, Stabilizing Orbit, Docking, Deorbit Burn, Reentry, and Landing, each with its own set of instructions to follow. The original Atari 2600 version came with an overlay since it made use of all the switches.</p>"
