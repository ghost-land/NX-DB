    "description": "<p>A Short Puzzle Game made for BYOG 2021 Game Jam.</p>\n\n<p>Send Commands to a Bot and help him reach his destination.\u00a0</p>\n<p>Use different cameras to scout out the map. And send the steps to reach the end to Bot.</p>\n\n<p>DevLog: \"I think I didn't pick the best font for the game.\u00a0 I thought it was ok, even good. But the initial testers review is 'It's hard to read and even confusing', which make them not properly go through the tutorial. The A/R and H/K look the really similar in game. It's specially bad if you misunderstand 'A' with 'R', as 'A' 'D' &amp; 'C' are the only keyboard keys used in game for controls. I can update the build, but since it's for a Jam, I don't want to change the initial build till the judging is over.\" - 24, Oct, 21\u00a0 - 19:34</p>\n<p>*Credits for the assets used are in game folder*</p>"
