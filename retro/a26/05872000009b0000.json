    "description": "<p>BurgerTime (\u30d0\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0, B\u0101g\u0101taimu) is a 1982 arcade game created by Data East initially for its DECO Cassette System. The player is chef Peter Pepper, who must walk over hamburger ingredients located across a maze of platforms while avoiding pursuing characters.<br />\nIn the United States, Data East USA licensed BurgerTime for distribution by Bally Midway as a standard dedicated arcade game. Data East also released its own version of BurgerTime in the United States through its DECO Cassette System. The Data East and Midway versions are distinguished by the manufacturer&#39;s name on the title screen and by the marquee and cabinet artworks, as the game itself is identical.<br />\nThe game&#39;s original Japanese title Hamburger (\u30cf\u30f3\u30d0\u30fc\u30ac\u30fc) was changed outside of Japan to BurgerTime, reportedly to avoid potential trademark issues. In addition to all releases in the Western world, &quot;BurgerTime&quot; was also the name used on the Japanese ports and sequels.<br />\nWhen Data East went bankrupt in 2003, G-Mode bought most of Data East&#39;s intellectual properties, including BurgerTime, BurgerTime Deluxe, Super BurgerTime, and Peter Pepper&#39;s Ice Cream Factory.</p>"
