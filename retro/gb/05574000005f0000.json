    "description": "<p>Bubble Bobble Part 2 (\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30dc\u30d6\u30eb2) is a game in the Bubble Bobble series. While it was never released in the arcade, two versions of the game were developed independently from each other (for the NES and Game Boy formats), with each game receiving a different story line as a result. The Game Boy version is known in Japan as Bubble Bobble Junior (\u30d0\u30d6\u30eb\u30dc\u30d6\u30eb\u30b8\u30e5\u30cb\u30a2).</p>"
