    "description": "<p>On November 15, 2001, Bungie released its legendary\u00a0first-person shooter for the original xBox. As a longtime fan of\u00a0Halo:\u00a0Combat Evolved, I 'm creating a\u00a0faithful demake for the Game Boy Color using GB Studio.</p>\n<p>I'm sharing a demo with the\u00a0first level, the Pillar of Autumn and have plans to continue adding levels to the project as time allows.\u00a0Can you blast through the hoards of Covenant boarders and escape the ship alive?\u00a0What lies ahead on the\u00a0mysterious ring formation?</p>\n<p>You can download the ROM or .pocket files to play on actual Nintendo hardware and the Analogue Pocket, or play the HTML version here in the browser.\u00a0However, downloading either game file offers the best experience due to sound limitations with the in-browser emulator.</p>\n<p><strong>CONTROLS:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Movement:</strong> WSAD or arrows<br/><strong>A:</strong> Z or J<br/><strong>B:</strong>\u00a0X or K<br/><strong>Select: </strong>Shift<br/><strong>Start: </strong>Enter</p>"
