    "description": "<p>Super R.C. Pro-Am is a racing video game developed by UK-based video game company Rare for Nintendo's Game Boy handheld console. It was released in North America in June\u00a01991 and in Europe on April\u00a023, 1992; it was re-released in 1998 as part of Nintendo's Player's Choice series, which included all Game Boy titles which sold over one million copies. It is the follow-up to the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) title R.C. Pro-Am, in which players race remote control cars from an out-of-vehicle perspective on a series of 24 tracks, avoiding obstacles and collecting items to improve performance in order to finish in the top three and qualify for the next track. The game can be played solo against three computer opponents, or two to four players can play simultaneously via the Game Link Cable or the Four Player Adapter.</p>\n<p>Super R.C. Pro-Am received moderate coverage from some video gaming magazines. It was praised for its graphics and sound, controls, challenge, and ability for up to four players to play the game simultaneously. Criticisms included repetitiveness in gameplay, lack of variety, and rapid scrolling on the Game Boy that may cause players to miss some items. It was featured on Nintendo Power's \"Top\u00a020\" Game Boy list for most of 1992.</p>"
