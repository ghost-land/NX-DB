    "description": "<p>A classic, retro style dungeon crawler / rogue-like. The game was made in only a few weeks, and is my first full game, so please consider this when playing it. \u00a0I am aware of the games flaws, but for a first game made in about 5 weeks,\u00a0 it is pretty good. Enjoy! Only compatible on Windows.</p>"
