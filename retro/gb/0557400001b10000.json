    "description": "<p>Monster Max is an isometric adventure video game developed by Rare and published by Titus Software. It was released for the Game Boy handheld game console in 1994. Monster Max was designed by Jon Ritman and Bernie Drummond and is very similar in both graphics and gameplay to Ritman and Drummond's 1987 title Head over Heels. The game sold poorly but received very positive reviews from critics. It was not released in North America.</p>"
