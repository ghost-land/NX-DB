    "description": "<p>Wizards &amp; Warriors X: The Fortress of Fear is a 1990 side-scrolling platforming video game developed by UK-based company Rare and published by Acclaim Entertainment for the Game Boy handheld game console. Taking place after the events in Ironsword: Wizards &amp; Warriors\u00a0II, the game features the knight warrior Kuros; he sets out to the Fortress of Fear to defeat the evil wizard Malkil, who, after 17\u00a0years of dormancy, has captured Princess Elaine and has imprisoned her there.</p>\n<p>Wizards &amp; Warriors X consists of five \"Chapters\" that comprise 18 levels. In contrast to the previous games in the series, gameplay is more linear. Reviews were mainly negative and focused on the slow gameplay, lack of continues, and the blurring caused by scrolling on the Game Boy. Moreover, in response to the game's title (Chapter\u00a0X), some gaming magazines asked what happened to the intermediate chapters in the Wizards &amp; Warriors series.</p>"
