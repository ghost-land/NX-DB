    "description": "<p>Sega Rally Championship is a 1994 arcade racing game developed by AM5 on the Sega Model 2 board. It was ported over to the Sega Saturn (by AM3) in 1995 and PC in 1997. The unique selling point of Sega Rally Championship was the ability to drive on different surfaces (including asphalt, gravel and mud), with different friction properties, with the car&#39;s handling changing accordingly. As the first racing game to incorporate this feature, Sega Rally Championship is considered to be one of the milestones in the evolution of the racing game genre. It was also an early rally racing game and featured cooperative gameplay alongside the usual competitive multiplayer.<br />\nThe music for the arcade game was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi (with one track by Tomoyuki Kawamura), while the Sega Saturn port&#39;s soundtrack consisted of a combination of newly composed music by Naofumi Hataya and arrangements of the arcade originals arranged and produced by Takayuki Hijikata previously released on the album Sega Rally Championship Ignition. Sega Rally has been listed among the best games of all time by various publications.</p>"
