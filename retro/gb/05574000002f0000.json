    "description": "<p>Batman, also known as Batman: The Video Game, is a group of platform games developed by Sunsoft for the Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy, loosely based on the 1989 film of the same name. Despite having the same title, each is actually a different game. The NES title is arguably the best known and contains five levels culminating in a showdown with the Joker in the bell tower of Gotham Cathedral. It was received well despite changes from the movie upon which it was based.<br />\nSunsoft followed up the release of Batman with Batman: Return of the Joker.</p>"
