It was the last \"Olympic\" video game released for the fourth generation of consoles, as well as the Game Boy.</p>\n<p>It follows the already common button mashing techniques of previous (and future) games, with the usual exceptions.</p>\n<p>It has 10 events (three more than Olympic Gold), with all but two based on track and field events. Unlike Winter Olympics, there are no major differences between each event on different platforms.</p>"
