    "description": "<p>Yoshi\u2122 is an action/puzzle game starring Mario&#39;s dinosaur buddy Yoshi<br />\nwho has been imprisoned in an egg. Now it&#39;s raining Goombas, Bloopers,<br />\nand Boo Buddies, and you have to help Mario\u2122 stop the airborne invasion.<br />\nAs the critters fall, catch them on trays. Stack two of a kind and they<br />\nboth disappear, or capture the whole bunch in between eggshells. When<br />\nthe eggshells match, out hatches Yoshi and up goes your score! The<br />\naction heats up as the characters fall faster and faster. To save the<br />\nday, switch and shuffle, and don&#39;t let your piles get too high!<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance. We hope you&#39;ll enjoy the new features (including off-TV play) that have been added to this title. See more Virtual Console games for Wii U.</p>"
