    "description": "You are one of the few survivors of a zombie cat-pocalypse.  With only your wits, your weapons, and a few turrets, you must defend yourself from the hordes of zombie-cats that come at night.  Grenade, blast, shoot, heal, and place traps to survive each wave until safety comes with the sunlight.<br/><br/>This is Zap Zap Zombie Cats.  A mix between a turret defense game and an FPS.  Gameplay is split into two parts: a day portion where you must build and upgrade various turrets during the day to prepare for the night invasion, and a night portion where you take place in the action from a stationary position atop your base.  During this stage, you can switch between 3 various cats, each with a different weapon and ability to utilize against the horde.<br/><br/>Zap Zap was made from a team of college students looking to gain experience and learn about the game-making process.  We know the game won't be perfect, but we hope to improve our skills and greatly appreciate any and all feedback from players.<br/><br/><strong>Features:</strong><br/>3 Characters, each with their own unique weapon and ability,<br/>8 Different enemies,<br/>13 Turret types,<br/>3 levels of upgrade per turret,<br/>and 10 levels with a tutorial and boss stage"
