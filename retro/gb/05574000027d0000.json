    "description": "<strong>Boldly go where no man has gone before...</strong><br/>Beam aboard the Starship Enterprise for Interplay's classic adventure game <strong>Star Trek: 25th Anniversary!</strong>  Set during the USS Enterprise's original five year mission to explore strange new worlds and to seek out new life and new civilizations, each of your missions is styled as an episode of an imagined fourth season of the original television series.<br/><br/>Discover and explore new planets, starships and space stations.  Control away teams, including Kirk, Bones, Spock, and the occasional, expendable 'Red Shirt' security officer.  Use tricorders, communicators, phasers, teleporters and other gadgets to proceed through each mission.The best defense is a strong offense\u2014and I intend to start offending right now. <br/>-- Captain James T. Kirk<br/>The bridge of the USS Enterprise comes to life during space battles and exploration.  Order Mr. Sulu to raise shields and demand more power from Mr. Scott, all accompanied by authentic sound effects and an original Star Trek musical score!"
