    "description": "<p>The game revolves around four quests: killing monsters, freeing fairies, or collecting gold/orbs with ten difficulties each. The difficulty determines how big the target number is, the stats the player starts with, and what monsters are encountered. Starting a quest creates a randomly generated dungeon where the player has one chance to reach the goal \u2013 death means a new dungeon has to be created. Beating a difficulty level unlocks the next; this is also the one thing the game saves.</p>"
