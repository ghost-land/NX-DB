    "description": "<p>Hit the Ice is a hockey video game originally released by Williams to arcades in 1990. Featuring a cartoonish representation of the sport, Hit the Ice features games with three players on each team (forward, defense, and goalie). Unlike standard hockey, there are very few rules, as players are encouraged to trip, elbow and kick opponents.</p>\n<p>Taito released ports of Hit the Ice for the TurboGrafx-16, Mega Drive, Game Boy and Super NES. An NES version was developed but not released.</p>"
