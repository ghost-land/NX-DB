    "description": "<p>Star Fox Adventures is an action-adventure video game, developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. Although the game&#39;s original concept was intended for the Nintendo 64, Shigeru Miyamoto convinced Rare to re-design the game to be both a part of the Star Fox series and as a launch title for the GameCube. The game was released on September 23, 2002, and was the final Nintendo game that Rare developed, before it was acquired by Microsoft to be a part of its Xbox division the day after the game&#39;s release in North America. The game&#39;s story takes place after the events of Star Fox 64, in which players take control of Fox McCloud who is sent on a mission to visit a planet in the Lylat System and save it from destruction.<br />\nThe game received mostly positive reviews, notably on its detailed graphics, new character designs on characters including Fox, and its dynamic environments. However its Legend of Zelda-influenced gameplay received mixed feedback, while there were mixed reactions from critics and fans alike in regards to Rare&#39;s departure from Nintendo following the game&#39;s release.</p>"
