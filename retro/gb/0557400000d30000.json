    "description": "<p>Final Fantasy Legend II, originally released in Japan as Sa\u30fbGa2: Hih\u014d Densetsu (Sa\u30fbGa2 \u79d8\u5b9d\u4f1d\u8aac, Sa\u30fbGa2 ~ The Treasure Legend), is a role-playing video game developed by Square Co. for the Game Boy handheld console as the second game of their SaGa series. Initially released in December 1990 for Japanese audiences, the game was translated and released in North America in November 1991 by Square America Co, and again in 1998 by Sunsoft. Like its predecessor, the English version was re-branded as a Final Fantasy title due to the series' popularity in the Western territories. The game's development was headed by lead designer Akitoshi Kawazu, who had worked on the previous title, with a music staff consisting of Kenji Ito and Nobuo Uematsu. In 2009, an enhanced remake of the game was announced for the Nintendo DS titled SaGa 2 Hih\u014d Densetsu: Goddess of Destiny (\u30b5\u30ac2\u79d8\u5b9d\u4f1d\u8aac GODDESS OF DESTINY, SaGa2 The Treasure Legend ~ Goddess of Destiny), featuring three-dimensional graphics, new story elements, and an arranged soundtrack.</p>\n<p>The game is set in a fantasy world where the player assumes the role of one of eight different characters of varying race and gender who leaves on a journey to find their lost father and discover the secret of \"Magi\", a substance created by the gods that holds powerful magic. Final Fantasy Legend II was largely well-received worldwide during its original release, with readers of Japanese magazine Famitsu voting it the 94th greatest game of all time in a 2006 poll.</p>"
