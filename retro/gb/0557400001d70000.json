    "description": "Military Madness is a turn-based strategy game that takes place on the moon in 2089, with the player controlling the Allied-Union forces against the Axis-Xenon forces. Units cannot be produced, but the Allied-Union forces could \"capture\" enemy units if they were in factories, or find unsecured factories and gain units from them. Units could also be repaired by returning them to factories under Allied-Union control."
