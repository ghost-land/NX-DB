    "description": "<p>\n      Pac-Man makes a rare appearance outside of a maze environment in \n      Pac-Attack, a fun and quirky puzzle game! This unique entry in the genre \n      puts its own twist on established conventions and adds one of gaming\u2019s \n      most iconic characters to the mix. The goal is simple: keep your screen \n      clear of falling blocks and ghosts by lining up blocks horizontally, \n      causing them to disappear. Clearing the ghosts, though, requires the \n      help of a hungry Pac-Man (who just happens to swing by every so often \n      for a snack). It\u2019s up to you to get all of the ghosts lined up for him, \n      because Pac-Man will keep eating them until he is stopped by a block or \n      he runs out of ghosts. In addition, his range of movement on the playing \n      field is limited to horizontal or downward\u2014thus adding further strategy. \n      There are three game modes to choose from: 1 Player Normal, 2 Player \n      VS., and the challenging 1 Player Puzzle. Feel like gobbling up some \n      ghosts?\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
