    "description": "Super death arena is an online horde mode survival game where you fight increasingly larger waves of mutants in an all out arena brawl. The goal is to survive ten waves of increasingly more mutants where you receive better and better weaponry to use. Keep moving and look out for bear traps that spawn in the level so you don't get stuck, and keep a distance when blowing up explosive barrels in the levels, they damage mutants as well as yourself or other players.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nYou will receive XP for each zombie kill, dismemberment, wave survived and more, and when you level up you receive a loot box. These loot boxes unlock new gear to customize your character with."
