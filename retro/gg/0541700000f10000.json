Dr. Eggman (AKA Dr. Robotnik) has stolen the Red<br />\nChaos Emerald to create nuclear weapons. This has thrown the remaining<br />\nChaos Emeralds off balance, causing them to transport to a parallel<br />\nuniverse. As a result, Sonic&#39;s home, South Island, is sinking into the<br />\nocean! Play as Sonic and Tails, and speed through various levels in your<br />\ncrusade for the six Chaos Emeralds. Perform Strike Dashes and Super<br />\nPeel-Outs as Sonic, or Spin Dash and Fly as Tails, and explore<br />\neverywhere to restore order in Sonic Chaos!<br />\nThis classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
