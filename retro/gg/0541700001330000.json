    "description": "<p>Sega Sports&#39; World Series Baseball, or simply World Series Baseball, is a sports game developed by BlueSky Software and published by Sega for the Genesis/Mega Drive and Game Gear. It is the first game in the series and was originally released in 1994. A version for the Sega 32X, World Series Baseball starring Deion Sanders, would follow in 1995.<br />\nThe game was a major advancement in Sega baseball games in that it included licensed MLB players and teams (the first baseball video game to have both such licenses [previous baseball video games only had one license]; they are based on the rosters for the 1994 MLB season), and relatively accurate gameplay.<br />\nThe series concluded with World Series Baseball 2K3 on the PlayStation 2 and the Xbox. After that, Sega contracted with 2K Games to take over their sports game contracts and the line continued as the Major League Baseball 2K franchise.<br />\nSan Diego Padres broadcaster Jerry Coleman provides the play-by-play for the game.</p>"
