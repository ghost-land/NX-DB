It is a sequel to &#39;Crystal Warriors&#39;, created exclusively in Japan.</h2>\n<p>Players take control of Eva, a disgraced female knight who was sentenced for a crime she did not commit and subsequently banished from the kingdom she used to serve. Over the course of the story, Eva will make alliances with different characters and attempt to clear her name.</p>\n<p>Taking after its predecessor &#39;Crystal Warriors&#39;, its legacy of combat remains untouched, although a select few classes have been polished to allow for more flexibility. With a team of up to five members, the player marches through the terrains - vanquishing onslaughts of enemies along the way. Level up and gear up with the aid of local villages, as you engage in battles that rely heavily on your choice of strategy, and persevere with your crew members still intact!</p>"
