    "description": "Factory Panic is a game about managing the bins at an ore processing facility.\r\n<p>As the bins overflow, the ore spills out all over the floor and slows your movement -- so while you need the ore to match wanted alloy patterns and get big points, you need to keep your work area clean lest the factory halt due to unsafe conditions.</p>\r\nControls:\r\n<p>Move: Left &amp; Right OR A &amp; D<br/>Grab/Drop: X or LMB<br/>Sweep: C or RMB</p>"
