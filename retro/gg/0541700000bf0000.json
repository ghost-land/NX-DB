    "description": "<p>Pengo (\u30da\u30f3\u30b4) is an arcade game developed by Coreland and published by Sega in 1982. The player controls Pengo, a red penguin that resides in the Antarctic. The game takes place in an overhead maze made of ice blocks, where Pengo fights the trolling, blob-like Sno-Bees. The objective of the game is for Pengo to survive a series of rounds by eliminating all Sno-Bees, while amassing bonuses by bringing together the three diamonds dispersed in the maze.</p>\n<p>There are two versions of the arcade game, each with different music. The first uses \"Popcorn\" as the theme, and the second has original music. There are other small differences as well.</p>\n<p>Pengo was ported to the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 8-bit family, and Sega Game Gear.</p>"
