    "description": "<p>Players take control of physicist and reluctant spy Dr. John Russell in his early days, investigating at a British research facility in this prequel to adventure game Undercover: Operation Wintersun, an exciting hunt for a Nazi nuclear bomb in the Second World Warm. Undercover: Dual Motives features both classic adventure gaming elements for on-the-go, as well as using the unique capabilities of the DS to implement novel ideas. In addition to John Russell, players have access to a second playable character in Audrey, the secretary of the facility&#39;s director. Both screens of the DS are used, when Russell and Audrey investigate. Working separately, the player is in control of one of them at a time, directing them via the touchscreen and stylus. The other screen displays the currently inactive character, which he can switch over to at any time. The challenge: cleverly using the individual abilities of the two different characters in order to solve the game&#39;s logical puzzles \u2013 even if they are in different rooms.</p>"
