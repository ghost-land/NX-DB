Feel the Magic: XY/XX is exactly the \n      kind of visionary, high concept title that only Sonic Team and SEGA can \n      deliver. The game\u2019s hero is doing everything he can to score a date with \n      a sunny beauty. He enlists the help of the Rub Rabbits \u2013 a suave gang of \n      super performers who wear plastic, members-only rabbit ears \u2013 to help \n      him get her attention. Through a series of madcap performances our hero \n      manages to impress the girl. When he finally takes her out, the \n      craziness really begins: a rival suddenly appears and a dark cloud is \n      cast over their love.

Of course, he needs your help. Our hero \n      is faced with some of the quirkiest challenges around. When 100 bulls \n      rush toward the girl, you must tap every one to make sure they fall out \n      of the way. You will guide him as he tries to ride a unicycle across a \n      catwalk. You'll blow into the built-in microphone to blow out candles \n      before they start a fire. And that's only the tip of the Feel the \n      Magic's wacky gameplay iceberg.\n    </p><p>\n      If the hip, stylized art and addictive touch-screen gameplay wasn't \n      enough, you can unlock features for your beauty.
