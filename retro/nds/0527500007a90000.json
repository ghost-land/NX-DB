    "description": "<p>UNO is a video game adaptation of a famous card game developed in the 20th century. The aim is to be the first one to win 500 points. There is also a variation of the game called Uno Rush, announced two years later than the original.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The rules and card design do not differ from the original. Four players are sitting across the table.<br />\nEvery player can check out his points in the composite chart. The round proceeds clockwise, it is supported by the revolving arrows and sound effects. The deck consists of 108 cards, 25 of each color. When it\u2019s a player\u2019s turn to go, he has to match the top card in the discard pile based on color, number or symbol of the card. They are dealt automatically to each player. It lets one focus on the game itself rather than on the mechanics.   </p>\n<h3>Key Features</h3>\n<p>The main visual appearance is a red screen and slow music so that the game screen can set up the background. There is not much action in the setting as the main processes appear between the players. Just like the original, one can\u2019t see the opponents\u2019 decks, so their goal is to become the first one to gain points. The player can also change the appearance in different game versions. For example, in Partner Uno the player with partners sit across from each other; the Xbox Live Version supports the webcams, which makes the action more intense. The video game has several teams over the internet, so it is possible to participate in live tournaments with players from around the world.</p>"
