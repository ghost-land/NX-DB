    "description": "<p>\n      Dementium tells the tale of a man who awakens to find himself alone, \n      with no memories of his past, in a derelict hospital that is frozen in \n      time. Confronted by the deadly, grotesque surgical experiments that \n      wander the halls, a series of challenging puzzles and a cast of peculiar \n      characters, he must face his deepest fears, unlock the mysteries of the \n      hospital, and escape with his life.\n    </p>"
