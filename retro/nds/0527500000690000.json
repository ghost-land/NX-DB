    "description": "You tried to fight the evil that you encountered in this gloomy dungeon, but it all went and went on you. Well thinking, you make the decision to run, because even with enough magic, you do not have enough of it for all monsters. They seem to endlessly appear. Throwing everything, you run, but it's not so easy, because the monsters are still in the dungeons!<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe plot of this game unfolds immediately after the events of the first part, where you had to fight off the crowd of ardent monsters through magic. You somehow managed to choose, but the adventure does not end there! You realized that it is useless to fight and you will have to flee.<br/>\r\nOn the way you will be waiting for:<br/>\n<br/>\r\n- creepy montsers<br/>\r\n- steep precipices<br/>\r\n- nice bonuses<br/>\n<br/>\r\nand much more!"
