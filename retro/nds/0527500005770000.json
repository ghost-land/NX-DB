Starting out as a Student Ranger, you quickly earn the \n      title of a full-fledged Pok\u00e9mon Ranger. As you succeed in more and more \n      missions, you will aspire to become the highest Ranger rank: Top Ranger. \n      Along the way you meet and capture all kinds of different Pok\u00e9mon.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      How to progress through the game: Capture wild Pok\u00e9mon and create \n      a team to clear obstacles and puzzles encountered along the way. After \n      using a Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s ability, it will leave your team; however, you will \n      have a Partner Pok\u00e9mon that will always stay by your side. As you \n      progress through Missions and Quests, your Capture Styler becomes more \n      powerful, giving your Styler more Energy and eventually advancing you to \n      the level of Top Ranger.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Characters: Hundreds of Pok\u00e9mon. Players can choose to be a boy \n      or girl Pok\u00e9mon Ranger.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n      Special powers/weapons/moves/features: Use the Capture Styler to \n      capture wild Pok\u00e9mon. Once they are captured, wild Pok\u00e9mon will follow \n      the player around until their powers are used (either in a Pok\u00e9 Assist \n      or a Field Move).\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 A Pok\u00e9 Assist is when the player uses an already captured Pok\u00e9mon to \n      help capture another wild Pok\u00e9mon.\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 A Field Move is when the player uses a captured Pok\u00e9mon\u2019s power to \n      clear an obstacle in the way or perform another helpful function.\n    </p><p>\n</p><p>\n</p><p>\n      \u2022 Pok\u00e9mon Ranger is a unique action-adventure series that features a \n      fun, different way to capture Pok\u00e9mon with the Nintendo DS stylus, which \n      controls an item called the Capture Styler in the game. Players circle \n      the Pok\u00e9mon they want to catch by drawing circles around them on the \n      touch screen. When you complete certain Quests, the Ranger Union awards \n      you with power-ups, which add new upgrades and functions to your Capture \n      Styler, allowing you to advance as you work to eventually become a Top \n      Ranger (the most revered Ranger of all).\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Now you can partner with a variety of different Pok\u00e9mon of each type \n      to complete Missions\u2014giving you many options on how to approach \n      different challenges. Every Pok\u00e9mon is different, and capturing a \n      Pok\u00e9mon allows you to use its abilities to overcome various obstacles \n      and challenges you will face along the way. The job of a Pok\u00e9mon Ranger \n      is never done: your duties will include fighting wildfires, rescuing \n      people or even delivering an important package.\n    </p><p>\n      \u2022 Your journey to become a Top Ranger takes you to the new region of \n      Almia.
