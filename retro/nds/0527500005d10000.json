    "description": "<p>GRID is a racing game that lets the player dive into the motorsport, assume the real racer\u2019s role and even control their own racing team. Races and racing championships are held in three main locations \u2013 the United States, Europe, and Japan. All racing circuits in the game are the mixture of imaginary and the existing ones. The gameplay is divided into 6 racing classes: GT championships, drifting, touge (climbing the narrow mountain pass like Pikes Peak), open wheel racing, demolition derby, and 24 Hours of Le Mans (additional at the end of the season). Each car of 43 available in the game is tied to one of the event types. Several professional teams compete within these championships. Therefore, to start the career player have to choose one of the disciplines and a professional team to join. While progressing GRID gives an opportunity to create your own racing team, hire sponsors and other drivers, and participate in different events. The gameplay also has a remarkable feature called \u201cflashback\u201d that allows rewinding time to prevent driver\u2019s mistakes.</p>"
