    "description": "<p>\n      When their grandfather passed away, Mel and Mark were left in charge of \n      his toy shop with the condition that if they couldn\u2019t make it successful \n      within three years, it would be donated to the city. It\u2019s up to you to \n      help the two make toys, satisfy demanding customers, explore the city, \n      and ultimately return their grandfather\u2019s toy shop back to the booming \n      business it once was!\n    </p>"
