    "description": "<p>Fossil Fighters\u2122 blends the timeless human fascination with<br />\ndinosaurs with the fun of building a collection. The game lets players<br />\nbuild a collection of more than 100 fantastical dinosaurs known as<br />\n\u201cvivosaurs.\u201d This new game incorporates elements of discovery, tactics<br />\nand strategy as players try to get the best vivosaurs on their teams to<br />\nbattle it out on the field.</p>\n<p>Players dig for fossils and use the touch screen of the Nintendo DS\u2122<br />\nsystem to hammer, chip, drill and brush away the bits of rock around<br />\nthe fossil. When their efforts result in the buildup of dust, players<br />\nblow into the Nintendo DS microphone to blow the dust away.</p>\n<p>The game rates players on how well they handle the fossils during the<br />\ncleaning process. The more carefully and completely a player cleans a<br />\nfossil, the more powerful the vivosaur will be in battle. Vivosaurs<br />\ncan also gain more power through battles.</p>\n<p>Players must collect various parts of each vivosaur. The head must be<br />\nfound first to bring a vivosaur to life while the body, arms and legs<br />\ncan be added to increase its power on the battlefield and imbue it<br />\nwith special powers.</p>\n<p>The game features an engrossing role-playing storyline and vast<br />\nenvironments for players to explore.</p>\n<p>Players can connect wirelessly with friends to battle or trade their<br />\nfossils.</p>"
