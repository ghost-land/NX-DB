Brain Age is inspired by the research of Dr. Ryuta Kawashima, a \n      prominent Japanese neuroscientist. His studies evaluated the impact of \n      performing certain reading and mathematic exercises to help stimulate \n      the brain.\n    </p><p>\n      Brain Age presents quick mental activities that help keep your mind in \n      shape. Activities include quickly solving simple math problems, counting \n      people going in and out of a house simultaneously, drawing pictures on \n      the Touch Screen, reading classic literature out loud, sudoku and more!\n    </p><p>This classic game is part of the Virtual Console service, which brings you great games created for consoles such as NES\u2122, Super NES\u2122 and Game Boy\u2122 Advance.
