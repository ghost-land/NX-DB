It is possible to create a completely new species using an in-game editor. It is up to the player to control the evolution process. </p>\n<p>The game is divided into several stages. After each stage, the player&#39;s gameplay is evaluated and a special bonus that is going to evolve the next stages is given based on their actions. The creature you made is evolving through every stage and changes its&#39; physique.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, you choose one of six planets to settle your creatures on. The first stage of the game is called Cell. The player controls a microorganism that lives in the water. In order to survive, the microorganism has to consume pieces of meat or seaweed and avoid being eaten by other water inhabitants. </p>\n<p>During evolution, your cell develops a brain and migrates to the shore. The in-game editor opens where you can add legs for your creature. The players meet other species that can be cooperated with or eaten.</p>\n<p>After that, three stages are available for the player: tribe, civilization, and space. The latter is endless.</p>"
