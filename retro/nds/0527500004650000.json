The shadow can also be told to stay in place, which makes the player able to jump on top of the shadow to reach higher areas.</p>\n<p>There is 5 areas and a total of\u00a015 fully completable and polished\u00a0levels with different kinds of puzzles like rolling boulders on buttons, activating levers, gathering keys and more.\u00a0 The art in the game is beautiful and eye-catching.</p>\n<p>Each area in the game has a different look and aesthetic to it with each having a unique song. The soundtrack is composed with well fitting\u00a0and unique themes,</p>\n<p>It is also said, that the game contains hidden secret areas with unique collectables...
