    "description": "<p>\n      The King of Bretwalde is dead. His passing, both unexpected and unusual, \n      leaves the kingdom in distress. As one realm mourns, another readies for \n      war; the Grand Meir Empire, intent on conquering the world, prepares to \n      strike the empty throne. Taken by surprise, the army of Bretwalde \n      collapses under the vicious assault, and the capital city of Egvard is \n      quick to fall. Only Spanta, the sacred blade, can spare the kingdom of \n      its fate. Free it of its curse and restore honor and peace to the land!\n    </p>"
