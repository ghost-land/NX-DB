    "description": "<p>\n      Throughout the world, the people of the major powers throughout the land \n      live in peace and prosperity, unaware that a great evil lurks on the \n      horizon. There is a clandestine group, under the guise of scholarly \n      research, plotting to resurrect a goddess whose time has long since \n      passed. To achieve this goal, they need two things; a vessel of flesh \n      and blood to house the spirit of the goddess, and the lives of every \n      living being offered up as a sacrifice.<br/>It is against the backdrop of \n      this coming chaos that Ares, an orphan from a small, forgotten village, \n      sets out to seek his fortune as an adventurer. At the start of his \n      journey, he encounters a beautiful young girl with mysterious powers \n      named Sierra, who has not only lost her memories about herself, but also \n      of the world around her. Together, they embark on an adventure that will \n      ultimately decide the fate of the entire world.\n    </p><p>\n      Features<br/>\u2022 Flexible Character Development System - Characters \n      earn both Status and Skill Points each time they gain a level, and these \n      points can be allocated to customize their skills across a wide range of \n      different job classes such as Swordsman, Thief, and Merchant.<br/>\u2022 \n      Upgradable Weapons and Armor - Characters\u2019 armor and weapons can be \n      upgraded by a blacksmith, or by affixing effect cards dropped by \n      defeated monsters.
