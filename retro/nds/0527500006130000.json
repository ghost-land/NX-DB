It's the sort of place where you could build a \n      farm, raise a family and begin new memories, but there's something \n      unsettling about the recent earthquakes. Is an unseen evil taking root \n      in this beautiful and magical land?\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
