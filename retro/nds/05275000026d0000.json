Brawling is the formula for<br />\nFullmetal Alchemist: Dual Sympathy, a side-scrolling action game that<br />\nputs players in the role of Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, on a<br />\njourney to combat the evil Homunculi and acquire the fabled<br />\nPhilosopher\u2019s Stone.</p>\n<p>Alchemy might be hard, but controlling Fullmetal Alchemist is easy. You<br />\npress A to attack and B to jump. Players can execute different attack<br />\ncombos, but make no mistake: the game&#39;s formula calls for tons of<br />\nbrawling.</p>\n<p>The most valuable attacks come from the DS touch screen. Each of the six<br />\nplayable characters have special attacks, and to activate them, all<br />\nyou&#39;ll need to do is touch the appropriate icon on the touch screen.<br />\nEdward, for example, can put up walls and produce an explosion from a<br />\ncannon. To activate these attacks, you&#39;ll just need to touch the<br />\nrespective icon.</p>\n<p>As you fight through each level, you&#39;ll occasionally come across<br />\ntouch-screen challenges. You won&#39;t need to do this on-the-fly, which is<br />\nimportant to note. The game will stop and let you prepare for the<br />\nchallenge. In one challenge, for example, you&#39;ll need to untie a<br />\nkidnapped person.</p>\n<p>Bottom Line<br />\nAlthough this game will mainly appeal to Fullmetal<br />\nAlchemist fans, those who like brawlers should give it a look.</p>"
