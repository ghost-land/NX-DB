    "description": "<p>\n      Spell casting meets block matching in this wicked fusion of magic \n      battles and puzzle solving skills. Ingrid didn't play nice with the \n      other boys and girls so she decided to make some new friends...from her \n      stuffed animals. Once her toys came to life they needed life skills, and \n      she was happy to teach them 24 devastating spells to use and abuse.\n    </p>"
