    "description": "<p>Rayman Raving Rabbids is a portable version of the console game of the same name which was released for the Nintendo DS in 2007. Unlike both the console versions and the Game Boy Advance version, this game uses 3D graphics but plays as a sidescroller throughout the majority of the game. Like the console version there are several minigames which have to be completed to progress.</p>\n<p>The game takes usage of the Rayman 2 engine, and several elements are holdovers from the Nintendo DS version of Rayman 2, including the menu fonts, Rayman&#39;s model, sounds, textures and animations.</p>"
