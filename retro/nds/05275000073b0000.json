    "description": "<p>Theresia is a psychological horror visual novel adventure game from a first-person perspective, consisting of two stories, each sharing a common background: an unnamed country, presumably under strict martial law by the time the game takes place, is engaged in a fierce and bloody war with an unspecified opposing nation. No further details are provided: the player is then thrust directly into the role of Leanne, the protagonist of the first half of the story.</p>\n<p>(Source of Description - Wikipedia; &#39;Theresia&#39;)</p>"
