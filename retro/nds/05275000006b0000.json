    "description": "<p>\n      B-17 FORTRESS IN THE SKY places the player in the heart of the air war \n      over Germany and the occupied territories in the autumn of 1944. Defend \n      the \"Lucky 25\" through 25 heart-pounding missions over France, the \n      Netherlands, and deep into the heart of Germany. Man each gunner \n      position, avoid deadly flak encounters, and make sure to drop those \n      bombs right in the o'le \"pickle barrel\". Once you've done your job for \n      Uncle Sam, you're flying back home to the waiting ticker-tape parade!\n    </p>"
