    "description": "<p>Zubo is a music-based rhythm-action game featuring a unique set of characters. Players enter the world of Zubalon to help the colorful and zany inhabitants, the Zubos, defeat an evil force which is bent on world domination. Players can befriend the Zubos they meet along the way, feed and nurture them, help them gain skills and strength, and assist them in their battles with the enemy, the dastardly Zombos. A key element to Zubo is music, which is intrinsic to Zubalon from its tuneful plant life through to its currency of musical notes. The player uses the music to drive the battles forward, synchronizing their stylus action and tapping in time with the musical beats to win. With 55 Zubos available to find and recruit to a player\u2019s squad, plus a wealth of interactions and mini-games, and the world of Zubalon to explore, Zubo offers a rewarding Nintendo DS experience.
