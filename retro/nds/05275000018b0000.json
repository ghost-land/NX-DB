    "description": "<p>\n      You are William Redmoor, recent recipient of a radical brain operation \n      intended to cure psychosis and current inmate at a clandestine treatment \n      center for the criminally insane. Your memories are fuzzy, but it \n      appears that your wife was murdered, and the evidence pointed toward you \n      as the killer. Here at the Bright Dawn Treatment Center you are under \n      the care of an enigmatic figure known only as The Doctor.\n    </p><p>\n      Whatever the Doctor\u2019s methods, they appear to work\u2014your psychosis is \n      gone\u2026 or is it? Demons you once battled have appeared once again. Worse, \n      it seems that the Doctor has some diabolical scheme to perform \n      experimental operations on scores of other inmates. You must not only \n      survive an onslaught of horrific beasts but also stop the Doctor from \n      achieving his goal. With all the insanity that surrounds you, you can\u2019t \n      tell if it\u2019s you or the world around you that has truly lost it. Just \n      how demented are you?\n    </p>"
