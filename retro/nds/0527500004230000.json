It is the first title of the Mega Man Battle Network series of games. It was originally released in Japan as a GBA launch game on March 21, 2001 and was released later that year in North America and Europe. It was also released via the Wii U Virtual Console in Japan on July 9, 2014, in Europe on July 24, 2014, and in North America on July 31, 2014.<br />\nBattle Network takes place during the 21st century in a world where society and everyday life is driven by the internet. Users are able to interact with and virtually explore nearly any electronic device using highly advanced, online avatars called &quot;NetNavis&quot;. The game follows a young boy named Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE as they solve a series of crimes instigated by the &quot;WWW (World Three)&quot; organization. Rather than share the platform gameplay of its predecessors, Battle Network is a tactical role-playing game (RPG) in which the player respectively controls Lan in the game&#39;s outside world and MegaMan.EXE in its virtual world. Battles take place in real-time; special abilities called &quot;Battle Chips&quot; can be accessed to fight off the numerous computer viruses present in the game&#39;s cyberspace environments.</p>"
