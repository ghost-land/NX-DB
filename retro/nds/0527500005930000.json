From dodgy deals to shifty tricks, do what you gotta do to go from small-time slumlord to filthy rich tycoon.<br />\nIn Constructor, you take on the role of a budding property tycoon who must do battle with your competitors to create a thriving and profitable city...in ANY way you see fit!<br />\nDesign and share city maps with online multiplayer battles against up to 3 of your mates.<br />\nBuild houses and factories, cope with the incessant demands of your tenants as well as keeping a whole bunch of UNDESIRABLE characters under control! This \u2018colourful\u2019 group of degenerates can also be used against the competition with humorous and catastrophic effect! If all else fails, call in the Mob\u2026</p>"
