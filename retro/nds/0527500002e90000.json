Our hero, Fazz, and his ragtag band of mercenaries \n      are thrust into the fight and are hired to protect one of the Ruins of \n      Ixia from the Valaimian forces. Unbeknownst to them, an insidious evil \n      begins to rise from the shadows... Will Fazz be able to stop it before \n      Mardias is destroyed?\n    </p>"
