    "description": "<p>Every thousand years a very rare planetary alignment makes Earth invisible to the Boss of the Bosses. Secret agencies of Heaven&#39;s and Hell&#39;s fighting each other for human souls, stop obeying any rules at all during that time. And even though Hell&#39;s agency traditionally does not obey rules, the balance between good and evil becomes gravely endangered when their opponents from Heaven also stop observing the rules! Dark Eaville, is on a mission to stop Heaven&#39;s agency and bring back the delicate balance between good and evil.</p>"
