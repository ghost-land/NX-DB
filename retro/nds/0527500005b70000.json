    "description": "<p>Puyo Pop Fever (\u3077\u3088\u3077\u3088\u30d5\u30a3\u30fc\u30d0\u30fc (Puyopuyo F\u012bb\u0101), is a puzzle video game developed by Sonic Team. It is the fifth main installment in the Puyo Puyo puzzle game series and the second Puyo Puyo game to be programmed by Sonic Team after Puyo Pop (which was released just after the series' original developer, Compile, went bankrupt). Sega, which acquired the series' rights from Compile in 1998, published all the Japanese versions of the game; the game was scarcely released internationally, and certain versions were released by other publishers in those areas. Only the Nintendo GameCube and DS versions were released in North America; Europe received both versions plus the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable versions. The NAOMI port to Dreamcast, released only in Japan, was the last Dreamcast game developed by Sonic Team, as well as being the only console version to use sprites in place of 3D models.</p>"
