    "description": "<p>\r\n      Roget, a solider of Pedda, is on a reconnaissance mission to Ferolia \r\n      with his companions, when their aircraft is shot down by the enemy and \r\n      abandoned by their carrier. The crew comes to realize that the mission \r\n      was a plot by their own superiors to eliminate them, with the invasion \r\n      on Ferolia being only the first step towards Pedda's domination of the \r\n      world. Witnessing the atrocities committed by the Peddan army, Roget and \r\n      his crewmates are forced to fight against their own countrymen.\r\n    </p>"
