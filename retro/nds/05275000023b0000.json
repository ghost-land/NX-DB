On this island lived Shirma, \n      Croma and a farm full of cheerful chocobos. Just when it looked like \n      they were all going to live happily every after, Croma brought back a \n      mysterious book from his latest journey. Without thinking twice, he \n      opened the dark tome and inadvertently invited misfortune upon the \n      island. Every nearby chocobo was sucked into the magical pages of the \n      wicked book.\n    </p><p>\n      Unbeknownst to all, Bebuzzu, who had once nearly laid waste to the \n      entire world, was imprisoned inside the pages of the book. Luckily for \n      the good guys, his strength was not fully restored\u2026at least not yet. \n      Taking the role of a chocobo, players must rescue their friends while \n      stopping Bebuzzu from regaining his full scope of abilities.\n    </p><p>\n      As of May 20, 2014, the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service for Nintendo \n      DSi and Wii systems has been retired.
