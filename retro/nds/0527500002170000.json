    "description": "<p>F-19 Stealth Fighter is a combat flight simulator developed and released in 1988 (PC DOS) and 1990 (Amiga and Atari ST) by MicroProse, featuring a fictional United States military aircraft. It is the 16-bit remake of the 8-bit game Project Stealth Fighter, which was released for the Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum in 1987. It was also ported to the NEC PC-9801 in Japan only, and the DOS version was re-released on Steam distribution platform in 2015.</p>\n<p>F-19 was developed before the F-117 stealth bomber was publicly revealed, and the aircraft of the game bears little resemblance to the actual F-117. Instead, game designers relied on the F-19 model kit released by Testors in 1986. The appearance of aircraft that appears in Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 matches the real F-117, however players of the second game are offered the choice of flying a fictitious version that carries more stores. Critically acclaimed, the game was followed by Night Hawk: F-117A Stealth Fighter 2.0 in 1991.</p>"
