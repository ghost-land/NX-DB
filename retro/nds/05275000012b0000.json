    "description": "<p>\n      The birds are coming! Join in on the chicken hunt as you use your \n      bullets to shoot the incoming birds, earning points before things get \n      out of hand and time runs out. The harder they are to get, the more they \n      are worth. Rack up points quickly by strategically targeting birds with \n      a higher bounty on their head. But aim carefully as accidentally \n      shooting other items on the screen means deducted points.\n    </p>"
