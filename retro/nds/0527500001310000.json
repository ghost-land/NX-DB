Having grown too strong, the Mana Tree's tremendous power \n      surges across the world, corrupting all that it touches. It is up to \n      four bold heroes to undertake a daring journey through scorching deserts \n      and icy wastes to drive the forces of malice from the world!\n    </p><p>\n      Square Enix\u2019s classic series looks absolutely beautiful on the DS.

And thanks to wireless local play, as many as four \n      friends can team up for an exciting adventure!\n    </p><p>\n      Never a company to rest on its laurels, Square Enix takes one of \n      gaming\u2019s most beloved franchises to a new level.
