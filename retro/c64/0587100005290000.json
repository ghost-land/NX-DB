    "description": "<p>Sky Runner is a 1986 game for PC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum made by Cascade. The PC version uses CGA graphics.</p>\n<p>The game is played from the 3rd person perspective with a 3D view similar to Space Harrier. Gameplay involved controlling an aircraft called a skimmer to shoot down enemy towers. After destroying enough, the skimmer would drop down a skybike, which the player would use to destroy other enemy skybikers, while avoiding obstacles like trees. After destroying enough enemies, a boss character called a harvester would appear, which the player would have to defeat. Upon defeating the harvester the game awards the player with money, and loops back to the player controlling the skimmer.</p>"
