    "description": "<p>Welcome to my visual novel!\u00a0In the story, you\u00a0live in a\u00a0world where every action you take is evaluated and given a score. There are 4 endings, which one you get is\u00a0determined by a point-based system.</p>\n<p>This is a prototype and was made in about four days, so there are\u00a0unfortunately no fancy graphics :(. If\u00a0the writing seems rushed, that's because it was.\u00a0</p>\n<p>I hope you'll still enjoy playing!</p>\n<p>~\u00a0Celeste</p>"
