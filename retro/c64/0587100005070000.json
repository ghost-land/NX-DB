    "description": "<p>Shamus: Case II is a 1983 video game for the Atari 8-bit family written by William Mataga and published by Synapse Software. Mataga also wrote the original Shamus and the scrolling shooter Zeppelin. A port to the Commodore 64 by Joe Vierra was released in 1984.</p>\n<p>Although ostensibly a sequel to Shamus, the gameplay is very different, combining aspects of platformers, maze games, and even Breakout.</p>\n<p>Case II was as well received as the original, it did not inspire a Case III, and Synapse was soon insolvent.</p>"
