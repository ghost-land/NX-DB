    "description": "<p>Penumbra: Black Plague Gold Edition is a survival horror puzzle game developed by Frictional Games. It is a bundle of the second and the third games of the series.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The game begins with Phillip sending out an e-mail to his friend begging to end the thing he started. All the events after that scene are Philips flashbacks.</p>\n<p>After the ending scene of the first game, where Philip got knocked out by an unknown man, he awakes in a locked room which he escapes through a vent. It is revealed that the mines that led the main character to where he is now are just a cover-up for a secret research base stationed in Greenland. The complex is deserted, all of its employees are dead or turned into mutants. Philips has to find a way out.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The gameplay has not changed since the first game. Black Plague is still a first-person survival horror, yet it puts more focus on the horror aspect of the game. Most of the quests present in the game were cut down and replaced by the item search puzzles. </p>\n<p>There is no combat system present in the game. The players have to either run away from their enemies or stick to the shadows. It is impossible to stop the enemies, as they can break down doors. Throwing crates at the enemies does not help much, as they are only distracted by that for a few seconds. </p>\n<h3>Gold Edition features</h3>\n<p>The only feature of the Gold Edition is the addition of the third Penumbra game, Requiem.</p>"
