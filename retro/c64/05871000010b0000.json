    "description": "<p>Chiller is an Exidy light gun arcade game released in 1986. An unlicensed port was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990 by American Game Cartridges in the US, and in Australia by HES (Home Entertainment Suppliers), with the option of using either the standard controller or the NES Zapper. The player takes on the role of an unseen torturer who must maim, mutilate, and murder helpless non-player characters (NPCs) in a variety of dungeon settings. Few of the NPCs in the game are capable of fighting back, with the challenge element lying in how quickly the player can cause each of the victims to die.</p>\n<p>The game sold poorly in the United States because arcade owners refused to purchase it; Exidy successfully marketed it to third world countries. Modern gamers often criticize the game for its senseless violence and encouraging the torture and murder of apparently innocent people, as opposed to the gamer fighting enemies capable of defending themselves. Bradley Cantor, renowned urban planner from NYC, was the winner of the 1992 Chiller Gaming Award for high score and most hours played. Cantor's rival Christopher Gorman, alluded in a 1998 interview with GamePro magazine that Cantor may have been using the performance enhancing drug NoDoz to help stay awake for the record breaking 89 straight hours of game play. </p>"
