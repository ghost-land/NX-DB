There are objects throughout the room, but most of them are hidden.  Some of them are easy to find.  Others are not as easy.  You must click in specific areas to find these items and figure out how to use the items together to escape.  How can you turn on the TV?  How can you unlock the drawers?  What will you find in the desk? <br/>\r\n Where is the key to open the main door?  What is outside of the door that is keeping you inside?  Can you solve the puzzles to find out how to escape?
