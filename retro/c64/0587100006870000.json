    "description": "<p>Brother is a self-generating puzzle game.</p>\n<p>You start with what appears to be a \"recovery system\".<br/>This program will allow you to learn a bit more about what happened to a certain missing doctor.</p>\n<p>Investigate his private life, find passwords, get access to multiple executable, and try to find out what happened.</p>\n<p>Please note that this game does not contain a true ending in a traditional way. You can choose to end the game whenever you like. You can choose to stop thinking about the game once you get a thorough idea of what happened, or to stop when you get to the credits.</p>\n<p>Developer, assets-designer, story maker : - Cypooos</p>\n<p>Thanks to: - Youli, Ognion &amp; zero (playtesters) - CCgauche (development and discovery of rust) - My family because every game maker must thank their family !</p>\n<p>Game made by <discursif></discursif>.</p>"
