A version for MS-DOS was released by KeyPunch Software. It was produced by Probe Software (the team consisted of David Quinn, Nick Bruty and David Perry). It was released in Spain (as \"Trantor\") by Erbe Software. The game is a mix between shoot 'em up and a platform game, but it was mostly known for its large and well-animated sprites.</p>"
