    "description": "<p>I made this game like a million years ago and it's very very bad -- the sound is too loud/broken, the walls kill you for some reason, and the UI is screwed up , but other than that it's basically Pac-Man. I\u00a0strongly recommend muting your computer if you play this.\u00a0 I would also recommend you don't play it.</p>"
