It runs on Namco System 1 hardware and was the last arcade title in the Pac-Man series until 1996. It is a pseudo-3D interpretation of the classic maze game genre using an oblique view and features many of the elements from the original 1980 Pac-Man arcade game, as well as several new features.</p>"
