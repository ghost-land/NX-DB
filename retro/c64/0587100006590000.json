Ignore what the actual game is about. Base it entirely on the name!\u00a0https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ZX_Spectrum_games</p><p><strong>Tools</strong></p><p>Gamemaker Studio: 2, Aseprite, Bosca Ceoil,\u00a0Bfxr, Beesbusy.</p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p><p>Windows fonts.</p>\n<p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p>\n<p>ZQSD / WASD: moving</p>\n<p>Left and Right arrows: shooting with the machinegun</p>\n<p>Space: shooting a torpedo (when it's ready and it has acquired a target)</p>\n<p>R: restart</p>\n<p>Your oxygen is going down.\u00a0You can recover it\u00a0by going above the white line. When it drops to zero, you start losing condition. If your condition drops to zero, you die.<br/></p>\n<p>There are two types of enemy ships: Bomber and Localizer. Bombers... bomb you when they detect you, but they\u00a0can't detect you if you stay under the red line. But Localizers can extend the detection area.</p>\n<p>Enemy ships can ONLY be destroyed with a torpedo. Your torpedo have a recovery time, so try to survive until then.<br/></p>\n<p>There are missiles underwater, coming from left and right. You can destroy them with your machine gun. You can't acquire them as target for your torpedo but if a a missile is on the way when you shoot a torpedo to a ship, it will destroy the missile and your torpedo.</p>\n<p>There is a mysterious creature deep in the sea. It seems it cannot die, but it sure will hurt you if you get too close.</p>"
