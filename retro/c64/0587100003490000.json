    "description": "<p>Lode Runner's Rescue is a 1985 action game developed by Joshua Scholar for the Commodore 64 and Atari 8-bit computers as a follow-up to Doug Smiths's Lode Runner. Lode Runner was published by Br\u00f8derbund, but the sequel was published under the Synapse Software name, a company acquired by Br\u00f8derbund in 1984. While the original Lode Runner is drawn from a side view, Lode Runner's Rescue uses isometric projection to give a 3D feel.</p>"
