    "description": "<p>Magicka: Wizard Wars was a MOBA game set in the world of the Magicka franchise. While its core gameplay was 4v4 battles, the game had a heavy focus on the sandbox aspect. The game had no single campaign and was free-to-play. Servers were shut down in 2016 due to the lack of audience.<br />\nDuring arena battles, players controlled wizards who used elements to create spells. There were eight elements tied to keyboard buttons; every combination of three elements gave a certain effect on the wizard himself, his teammates or enemies. As the amount of combination was huge, their usage was limited only by players\u2019 imagination. This mechanics was, in fact, a slightly reduced version from Magicka. As every element has an opposite one that counterattacks the spell, battles were based on the reaction rate of players.<br />\nThere were three modes: a classic three-lane map with mobs and bases, a team deathmatch, and a 1v1 duel.</p>"
