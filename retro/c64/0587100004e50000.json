    "description": "<p>There are ghosts all around us: from the past, bleeding into the present and worrying our\u00a0future. In this dissertation we explore Derrida\u2019s theory of hauntology and its applications\u00a0in archaeology. Drawing upon various case-studies, we discover that ghosts can be\u00a0identified through mixed approaches \u2013 excavation, memory, material traces and walking.\u00a0We then propose to merge these enactments into a radical methodology of hauntology,\u00a0choosing the Saracen Foundry as our site of inquiry.\u00a0</p>\n<p>This game represents phenomenology, audio, walking and\u00a0non-linearity are practiced and then transcribed into an audio-visual environment in\u00a0Twine, a creative-narrative engine. The final result is a fully-realized phenomenological\u00a0user-interface, wherein persons can navigate between related Saracen Foundry sites, and\u00a0conjure up revenants for their own speculation.</p>\n<p>Submitted in part fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of MA with Honours in Archaeology at the University of Glasgow 2016.\u00a0<strong>If you want to learn more, feel free to contact me at developer@rorypeace.co.uk!</strong></p>"
