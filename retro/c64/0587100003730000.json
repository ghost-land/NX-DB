Activision published the game in 1985 for several home computer systems.</p>\n<p>In Master of the Lamps, the death of an Arabian prince's father, the king, shatters three enchanted oil lamps, freeing the three genies trapped within. The genies overrun the palace; to contain them, the prince must reassemble the three broken lamps. The player, in the role of the prince wearing a white thawb and red keffiyeh, must journey into the seven dens of each genie, as each den contains one of the lamp pieces.</p>"
