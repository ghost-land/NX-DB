    "description": "<p>Aztec Challenge refers to either of two early arcade-style computer games published by COSMI, as well as two subsequent remakes. In all game versions the player takes control of a running Aztec warrior. The first was a side-scrolling platform-jumping game created by Robert Tegel Bonifacio and released in 1982 for the Atari 8-bit family. Subsequently a different game with the same title and overall theme was created by Paul Norman and released for the Commodore 64. It included a level in a modified-first-person 3D-style.</p>"
