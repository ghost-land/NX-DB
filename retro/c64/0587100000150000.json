    "description": "<p>Action Biker (also known as KP Skips Action Biker with Clumsy Colin in the UK) is a 1985 game for the Atari 8-bit family, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum released by Mastertronic. The game was a tie-in with snack food KP Skips, whose mascot was \"Clumsy Colin\" who featured in television adverts for Skips at around the time the game was published.</p>\n<p>Although marketed under the same title, the ZX Spectrum version of Action Biker differs significantly from the Atari and C64 versions, to the extent that Retro Gamer magazine featured it in their \"Same Name, Different Game\" column.</p>\n<p>The music was composed by C64 game musician Rob Hubbard.</p>"
