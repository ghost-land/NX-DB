    "description": "<p>PAYDAY The Heist is a dynamic co-op shooter that allows players to assume the role of a bank robber and to try on the criminal life from the first-person view. This game is the first part of the PAYDAY series and the beginning of the story of four outlaws \u2013 Dallas, Hoxton, Chains and Wolf. The gameplay is about completing 6 different heists throughout America alone (with bots) or in a team (up to 4 members). Each robbery could be carried out in two separate ways: players should decide whether stealth or a breakthrough attack is more suitable and prepare all the ammunition properly in advance. The squad of criminals searching for another \u201cbig score\u201d is set up against easy-to-manipulate civilians and powerful police forces, so players are to try their best to prevent the alarm signals and not to face armed resistance. However, if the heavy combat begins, the best option will be to keep shooting countless enemies down till the money is in the bag and the heist is over.</p>"
