    "description": "Featuring stunning art direction, reminiscent of watercolour paintings, the game will task players with writing their version of Mary Shelley's gothic classic.<br/><br/>In this exploration/adventure game, you play Frankenstein\u2019s Creature, a being with no memory and past. At the start of the game you know neither Good, nor Evil, you are a blank soul in an adult body. By exploring the world, you will experience your emotions, develop and write the first pages of your story. When confronted with mankind, there will be no way to escape the question of your origins : Who abandoned you in this world? Hunted by this question The Wanderer: Frankenstein\u2019s Creature will take you on an adventure throughout Europe. Your experiences - some brutal and tragic, others joyful - as well as your choices, will bring you closer to the truth with every step. But will you be ready to face this truth?<br/><br/>"
