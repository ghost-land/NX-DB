    "description": "In Eidolon, you start as a new student at Eidolon University. You're asked to introduce yourself to the new students. In doing so, you'll learn more about them, the true nature of the university, and yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nEidolon University has a 2-3 hour playtime but no two playthroughs will ever be the same due to extensive dialogue options and as many as sixteen unique endings per character.  You play as a new student at Eidolon university. As you interact with the other students (by clicking on them in whatever order you choose), you will have extensive branching dialogue options that unlock new areas, raise affection, and unlock special endings.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThis download includes the full game, free to play, with no additional content expansions anticipated. Play for free now and forever.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSome of the characters you will meet while playing include:<br/>\n<br/>\r\nErica (not-datable) \u2013 A bubbly sorority sister who'd love to party and make memories with you \u2013 or drink too much and forget them.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nMelody (datable) \u2013 She's hoping to save the world \u2013 and would love help picking up litter or protesting the new power plant, especially with an attractive student like you! If only she could find a way to graduate from the university and make a more meaningful impact...<br/>\n<br/>\r\nVivian (datable) \u2013 Voted most likely to succeed. She'll apply that same ambition in dating you and in trying to escape from Eidolon.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nAdrianna (datable) \u2013 The resident romantic, hoping to have her own happily ever after. Can you give her the romance she longs for or will she be forced to take matters into her own hands?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nBrooke (datable) \u2013 Athletic and skeptical about love \u2013 can you work your way into her heart? Or better yet, give her the adventure she craves?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nClaire (datable) \u2013 Curious about everything, she's eager to experiment with you in all kinds of ways. But her greatest experiment will be determining the true nature of her world.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nReia (datable) \u2013 More interested in books than romance, can you find a philosophy that incorporates love? Or one that explains who - what - she really is?<br/>\n<br/>\r\nSophia (non-datable) \u2013 The school's guidance counselor may have answers to the mysteries of the university \u2013 or at least towards better understanding why you seek them."
