    "description": "Your last objective: KILL<br/>An endless horde of D\u00e9mons flood in as you struggle to survive. Too angry to die, Shogun raises hell.<br/><br/>SHOGUN is an arcade style shooter that emphasizes running and gunning to stay alive. Rip through waves of increasingly difficult enemies hell-bent on your doom by shooting, looting, and eluding a bullet hell of cartoonish horror. Refuse death, explode with burning rage and tear asunder!!!<br/><br/>Inspired by the games that founded the fps genre, SHOGUN was created to give homage to the demon slaying experience in a bite sized form."
