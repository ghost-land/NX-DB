    "description": "<h3>Sing a song</h3>\n<p>Exclusive for PlayStation, released on PS3, and PS Vita in 2012, and later - in 2013 and on PS 4. Sound Shapes - is a game about music, in which you can and should not only listen but also create it yourself. Game events are tied to music. The player takes control of a dynamic ball, and find the music during the gameplay. It is a combination of side-scroller and music. Locations, through which the protagonist passes - are pierced with characteristic rhythms that create the appropriate atmosphere. The player after half an hour of the game can catch himself on what he unconsciously sings the motives from the game to himself.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>Back Hensen, who participated in the development, gave the game three of his compositions - \u201cCities,\u201d \u201cTouch the People,\u201d and \u201cSpiral Staircase.\u201d Each of them in its own way is played out within the game process. The original execution of the game, intuitive control, as well as uncomplicated but perfectly matched mechanics, making the game a real find for both a music lover and an ordinary player. The feeling of unusual events on the screen does not leave even after the game. There is no multiplayer in the game, but it is unlikely that it can be considered a minus for Sound Shapes.</p>"
