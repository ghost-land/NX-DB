    "description": "<p>Arkanoid (\u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30ce\u30a4\u30c9, Arukanoido) is an arcade game released by Taito in 1986. It expanded upon Atari&#39;s Breakout games of the 1970s by adding power-ups, different types of bricks, a variety of level layouts, and visual layering and depth. The title refers to a doomed mother ship from which the player&#39;s ship, the Vaus, escapes. It was widely ported to contemporary systems and followed by a series of remakes and sequels, including the 1987 arcade game Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh. Arkanoid revived the Breakout concept, resulting in many clones and similar games for home computers, even over a decade later.</p>"
