    "description": "This VR experience uses the architectural design by M@ STUDIO Architects for the 2016 National Gallery of Victoria (NGV) Architecture Commission titled \u201cHaven\u2019t you always wanted\u2026?\u201d which transplanted a familiar object (a suburban car wash) into an unfamiliar surrounding (the art gallery) and explores ideas of \u2018uncertain conditions\u2019 and \u2018dematerialisation\u2019 using materials such as multiple layers of cricket netting - that create moire effects - and hot pink astro turf.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2018If only\u2026\u2019 asks what if we could experience the changes we make to an architectural design in real time and from inside the architectural space and see the effects of the transformation from morning through to evening. The materiality of the pavilion can be changed in ways that may not, in reality, be possible or practical (such as gold netting), while you can teleport to different locations inside and outside the pavilion.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2018If only\u2026\u2019 also works with and extends some of the themes of the M@ STUDIO pavilion in order to develop atmosphere, mood and experience. It offers bubbles, fog, ghostly portals, the chill of a cold night and just you inside the pavilion changing the materials as many times as you like and watching the shadows, seeing what happens as the sun rises and sets. If only\u2026<br/>\n<br/>\r\n\u2018If only\u2026\u2019 is a collaboration between RMIT University\u2019s Centre for Game Design Research, M@ STUDIO Architects and d__Lab RMIT which explores game design experience and architectural design.<br/>\n<br/>\r\n----------------------------------------<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe National Gallery of Victoria (NGV), situated in Melbourne, is the oldest and most visited gallery in Australia.
