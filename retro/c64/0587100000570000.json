    "description": "<p>Astro Chase is a scrolling shoot 'em up game originally released by First Star Software in 1982 for the Atari 8-bit family. The company later licensed certain platform rights to Parker Brothers for release on several home computers, and to Exidy for use with their Max-A-Flex arcade cabinet.</p>\n<p>Gameplay takes place on a 2D scrolling map of space around Earth, which the player has to defend from an alien force. The primary target is a number of Mega-Mines, which approach the Earth and must be destroyed. The game is level-based (there are 36), and after all the Mega-Mines are destroyed the game progresses to the next level where players encounter a growing variety of enemy attack ships, with different speeds and offensive capabilities. An animated cut-scene is played every four levels.</p>"
