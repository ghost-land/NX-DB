    "description": "<p>In Die Hard: Vendetta, tactics and stealth are just as important as having a big gun and being a quick shot. The story picks up five years after the movie Die Hard With a Vengeance, and you play as LA cop John McClane. Your daughter, now a full-grown woman on the police force, finds herself in danger, and it&#39;s up to you to save her. In your investigation, you&#39;ll meet old friends, uncover helpful clues, and solve objectives--all while using stealth or an arsenal of weaponry to move past enemies.</p>"
