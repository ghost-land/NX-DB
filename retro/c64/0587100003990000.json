    "description": "<p>Mikie is a 1984 arcade game produced by Konami. The object of the game is to guide a student named Mikie around the school, classroom, and locker room to collect hearts which make up a letter from his girlfriend Mandy while being chased by various members of the school staff, such as teachers, coaches and cafeteria chefs. To defend himself, the game character can either head-butt or throw basketballs at school members to briefly stun them, while he can push students over with his rear end to find hearts in their desks.</p>"
