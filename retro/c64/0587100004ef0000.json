    "description": "<p>When Lavender woke up this morning, she wasn\u2019t expecting to be surrounded by a crowd of over-excited, skull-masked strangers with cake and balloons. After all, it wasn\u2019t her birthday; and this wasn\u2019t her home.<br />\nShe devises a plan to find her brother and escape from the outlandish townspeople of the Hollow - but is she prepared for the grave consequences?<br />\nGrimm\u2019s Hollow is a video game inspired by a longing for a short and sweet RPG experience with memorable characters, some humour, and a minimal need for grinding. (Consequently, the developer decided to try and make that game.)It has:<br />\nA lot of comfort food.A lot of cute ghosts.A lot of mean ghosts.3 haunted caves to explore!Multiple endings.</p>"
