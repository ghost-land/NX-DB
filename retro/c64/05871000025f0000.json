The game was released in conjunction with the film from Warner Bros. and Amblin Entertainment.</p>\n<p>In the NES game, the player controls Gizmo through various levels in the building, armed with weapons ranging from the genetically modified super tomato in the laboratory to the new matchstick-firing bow in the later sections. The goal of the game is to reach the Gremlin Control Center to wipe out all Gremlins inside. The Game Boy version was a side-scroller also featuring Gizmo.</p>\n<p>The Spanish company Topo Soft and Motivetime developed a sidescrolling Gremlins 2: The New Batch video game for Amiga,[1] Atari ST, Commodore 64, DOS, MSX, Amstrad CPC[2] and the ZX Spectrum,[3] distributed by Erbe Software and Topo Soft in Spain and by Elite abroad, being the first time a Spanish videogame company got an exclusive license from a Hollywood movie to make a videogame. The game had featured Billy Peltzer using a wide variety of weapons (flashlights, tomatoes, Frisbees and the like) to dispatch of Gremlin adversaries. The goal in each of the five levels is to locate a specific item required to see the game&#39;s good ending.</p>"
