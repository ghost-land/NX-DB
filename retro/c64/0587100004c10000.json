    "description": "<p>Rockford is a 1988 arcade game developed by Mastertronic&#39;s Arcadia Systems as an arcade spin-off of the home computer series Boulder Dash.</p>\n<p>On each of the five exciting worlds that you will be adventuring over, you will face a fresh set of mindtwistingly difficult puzzles, and a new range of mayhem wreaking monsters and a different type of treasure hoard. Each of the worlds contains four difficulty levels.  Each of these levels is completely different from any of the others.  There is a complete range of challenges, for every one of the sixteen screens that makes up a world has hundreds of puzzles for you to solve as you try to collect all of the treasure without ending up crushed under a rock.</p>"
