Have a Fun ride!\"</em></p>\n<p>Suddenly, you see a big monitor right on front of your face, who seems to either smile at you... Oh wait, that's just a <em>colon with a bracket</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MiKe Adventures: Round The World</strong> is a platformer game where you control MiKe, who's someone who seems to have gotten either lost or trapped in the WonderWorld, hence he doesn't really know why he's there, or what the purpose of anything is.</p>\n<p>[Only a demo is available at the moment.]<br/></p>"
