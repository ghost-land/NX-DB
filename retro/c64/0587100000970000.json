A direct sequel to Castle Wolfenstein, it is the second game in the Wolfenstein series, and the last installment to be released by original developer Muse Software before their closure. Unlike the original, Beyond Castle Wolfenstein was developed simultaneously for both the Apple II and the Commodore 64, but was quickly ported to MS-DOS and the Atari 8-bit family.</p>"
