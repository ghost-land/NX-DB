    "description": "<p>Archon II: Adept is a 1984 action-strategy video game developed by Free Fall Associates' Jon Freeman, Paul Reiche III and Anne Westfall, and published by Electronic Arts for various platforms. Adept is a hybrid of a tactical board game and action. Although it doesn't have the chess motif of the original Archon: The Light and the Dark, good vs. evil, one on one combat, magic, and power points remain central concepts.</p>"
