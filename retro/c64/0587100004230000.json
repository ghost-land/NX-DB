    "description": "<p>Pit-Fighter is a 1990 arcade fighting game by Atari Games, notable for its early use of digitized live actors. The Japanese arcade release was published by Konami.</p>\n<p>The graphical animations for the player character and opponents were created through a bluescreen process, where the various poses and moves of the characters were acted out by hired actors in front of a video camera. The game's on-screen character animation are replays of the actual footage, not a rotoscoped (redrawn) animation as was common in other games. Pit-Fighter was the second fighting game to use digitized sprites, after Home Data's Reikai D\u014dshi: Chinese Exorcist.</p>"
