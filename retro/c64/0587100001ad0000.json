    "description": "<p>Encounter (also known as Encounter!) is a first person shoot 'em up game originally released in 1983 for the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 programmed by Paul Woakes for Novagen Software. It was published by Novagen in the UK and Europe and by Synapse in North America. The gameplay is similar to that of Atari's 1980 arcade game Battlezone, but with scaled sprites instead of wireframe 3D graphics. Encounter is notable for moving large, screen-filling objects at a high frame rate. Woakes later developed Mercenary.</p>\n<p>Versions for the Amiga and Atari ST computers followed much later, in 1991.</p>"
