    "description": "Relive the classic fantasy role play experience that spellbound players in 1985. This game was a remastered combination of the three games from the Dunjonquest series (Temple of Apshai, Upper Reaches of Apshai, and Curse of Ra).<br/><br/>Create a character, buy equipment, enter the dungeon and prepare for adventure. Explore and fight your way to hidden treasure and magical items. Gain experience, cure your wounds, recover from fatigue and survive to reach the next level.<br/><br/>All that lies before you cannot be foretold, even by the Oracle.  I can tell you that the greatest adventure lies not in the din of sword or shield, or in the rapacious hoard of silver and diamond.  Nor in the gleam of distant sunsets, or the firm visage of mailed warriors who guard ancient kingdoms.  It lies within.  Within Apshai.  Within you."
