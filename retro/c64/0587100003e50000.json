    "description": "<p><strong><em>Odyssey is a 2D adventure shooter with a focus on combat and world building. You play as a space mercenary trying to get by in an uncaring universe. Your jobs start of simple but get more and more challenging both in difficulty and in morality. Fight your way through factories, abandoned space ships, and more in this fast paced adventure!</em></strong></p>\n<p>-----------------</p>\n<p><em><strong>Odyssey\u2019s primary mechanic is a shield and energy system that enables fast paced position heavy combat. In combat you are given a force field that is powered by a battery. As you take damage your force-field\u00a0gets weaker and weaker before finally breaking. If your force-field\u00a0is broken you will start to take actual damage and will die rather quickly.</strong></em></p>\n<p><em><strong>The catch to the system is that the battery that is powering your force-field\u00a0is the same battery that powers your weapons and your shots. This means as you shoot your weapon, you deplete your battery and precious charge for your force-field.</strong></em></p>\n<p><strong><em>Additionally a number of enemies can be rushed and disarmed before they get a chance to arm themselves, effectively ending combat with them and allowing you to pick up their weapon. To accomplish this, the player must be up close and personal, which will often put themselves in danger if they\u2019re not careful.</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong><em>It is this call and response based combat of shooting, covering, and disarming that powers Odysseys combat.</em></strong></p>"
