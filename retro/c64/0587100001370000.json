    "description": "<p>Cosmic Causeway was the sequel to Trailblazer written by Shaun Southern. While the original game featured a split-screen two player mode, the sequel is single-player only. The display is a full screen 3D view of the \"road\" ahead. Another major change is the addition of tunnels, with the player able to roll along upside down if the necessary icon has been selected.</p>"
