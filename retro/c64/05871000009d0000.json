    "description": "<p>Big Mac the Mad Maintenance Man is a computer game published in 1985 by Mastertronic for the Commodore 64. It is a platform game in the style of Manic Miner. The game&#39;s full title according to the cover is More Adventures of Big Mac the Mad Maintenance Man although the game&#39;s opening screen uses the shorter title. Most fans, however, simply remember the game as &#39;Big Mac&#39;.<br />\nThe player takes on the role of the title character who must negotiate a power station consisting of 18 separate levels (vaults). On each level the aim is to avoid a range of defences and press switches to shut down the vault.</p>"
