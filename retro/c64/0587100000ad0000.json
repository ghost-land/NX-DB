    "description": "<p>Blitzkrieg is a tough-as-nails tower defence game from Loui Studios. Complete with a built-in level creator,  so you can create and share levels with other players!<br />\nYou must defend the motherland from invading convoys of tanks, cars, and jeeps while enemy aircraft bomb vital buildings. Utilise an arsenal of flamethrowers, high-explosive cannons, artillery, machine guns, missile launchers, AA turrets, pill-box bunkers, and experimental tesla weaponry to survive the blitzkrieg.<br />\nEach level is a tightly woven puzzle of turret placement, optimisation, and upgrades. Careful strategy is the key to your survival.</p>"
