    "description": "Steel Eagle is a reference to classic arcade top-down view shooters with a scrolled map. Lead the Steel Eagle safely through 20 levels, destroying as many enemies as possible on the way. At the end of each level there is a landing pad waiting for you, which allows you to move to the next level. Of course, the landing pad is guarded by enemies.<br/>Once you reach the landing pad you will be able to exchange the points for additional force and strength of your \u201cSteel Eagle\u201d.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Main features:<br/>- 20 different levels.<br/>- simple vehicle development system, but giving the chance to try different development options.<br/>- the ability to unlock the FPS if the standard speed of the game will be too slow for you (test how many frames will take your computer!).<br/><br/>Sit at the controls of the \u201cSteel Eagle\u201d and get the most points.<br/><br/>"
