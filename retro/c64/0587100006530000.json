    "description": "<p>A 2D platformer from an independent Spanish studio. As two points, the player will reveal mysteries and secrets in the history of printing and font development, learn the history of the origin of typography. The plot begins in prehistoric times when people&#39;s writing was petroglyphic and reaches our times when the world is captured by pixelated nostalgia.</p>\n<p>There are ten worlds in total, which are associated with specific periods in the history of typography development. Each level is backed by a ton of documents and historical references, which reveal the context even wider. The developers did not make the game too complicated - its task is enlightening, and it should reach to the broader audience. All riddles are built on physics of game objects.</p>\n<p>One of the main puzzles is the controls. It is unusual and sometimes difficult to master. The game was praised by critics as one of the most innovative, offering the original concept. Available on mobile devices, consoles from Sony and on PC.</p>"
