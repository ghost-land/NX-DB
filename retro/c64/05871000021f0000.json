    "description": "<p>Gateway to Apshai is an action-adventure game for the Commodore 64, ColecoVision and Atari 400/800 home computers, developed by The Connelley Group and published by Epyx as a prequel to Temple of Apshai. It is, in principle, a more action-oriented version of Temple of Apshai, with smoother and faster graphics routines, more intuitive controls, fewer role-playing video game elements, and fewer room descriptions.</p>"
