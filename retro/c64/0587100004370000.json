    "description": "<p>Pole Position II (Japanese: \u30dd\u30fc\u30eb\u30dd\u30b8\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3II, Hepburn: P\u014dru Pojishon Ts\u016b) is the sequel to racing arcade game Pole Position, released by Namco in 1983. As with its predecessor, Namco licensed this game to Atari, Inc. for US manufacture and distribution, who also released a port of it as the pack-in game for their Atari 7800 ProSystem console. Pole Position arcade machines can be converted to Pole Position II by swapping several chips.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is the same as in original Pole Position with three additional tracks to choose from: Test (resembling Indianapolis Motor Speedway), Seaside (resembling the 1982 United States Grand Prix West circuit in Long Beach), and Suzuka.</p>"
