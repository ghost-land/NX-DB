When evil darkens the doorsteps of Twin Lakes City \u2013 hell, even when it just loiters around shop fronts or hangs out in shady alleyways \u2013 he\u2019s there, ready to investigate the cases that nobody else will. <br/>\r\nHe is The Darkside Detective.<br/>\n<br/>\r\nThe Darkside Detective is a micro-adventure game with a distinct sense of humour.
