    "description": "<p>Kung-Fu Master is a side-scrolling beat &#39;em up game produced by Irem as arcade game in 1984 and distributed by Data East in North America. The game was initially released in Japan under the title of Spartan X (\u30b9\u30d1\u30eb\u30bf\u30f3X, Suparutan X) as a tie-in based on the Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals (which was distributed under the same title in Japan); however, the game has no bearing on the plot of the film outside the names of the main protagonist and his girlfriend, allowing Irem to export the game without the license by simply changing the title.<br />\nThe players control Thomas, the titular Kung-Fu Master, as he fights his way through the five levels of the Devil&#39;s Temple in order to rescue his girlfriend Sylvia from the mysterious crime boss Mr. X.</p>"
