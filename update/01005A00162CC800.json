    "description": "“Reminiscent of the first person point and click classics.”\nSean Davies - Finger Guns\n\n“as puzzles, this is an absolutely exquisite collection, with challenges that had me frequently taking a breath at how clever they were.”\nJohn Walker - Buried Treasure\n\nAnother Tomorrow is a puzzle adventure that blends intricately rendered dioramas with first person exploration and puzzle solving.\n\nTrapped without your memories but equipped with a camera you’ll explore abandoned apartments, airfields, temples, and underground facilities to search for clues, solve puzzles, and unlock secrets to answer the question; who are you?\n\n–\n\nYour head’s pounding, your body cold. The air is ripe with something all too familiar. Blood.\n\nThe odour is unmistakable. But there’s something else. Something sweet but medicinal, an intoxifying cocktail of brown sugar, ethanol, and disinfectant.\n\nIt hurts to open your eyes, the lights are bright but it’s not that.\n\nMoving hurts, like you haven’t moved in a long time.\n\nQuestions racing through your mind; where are you, how long have you been here, what the fork is that taste?\n\nFeatures:\n• A first person point and click adventure game.\n• Trademark Glitch humour and puzzles that will leave you screaming at us.\n• The Glitch Camera to help you solve puzzles and keep track of clues.\n• Lots of clues to find and puzzles to solve.\n• A beautiful soundtrack and immersive sound effects.\n• A full Hint System to help you if you get stuck.\n• 9 save slots, share the game with your family!\n• Auto-saves your progress!\n",
