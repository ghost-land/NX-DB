    "description": "TENSEI is a very casual endless action game.\n\nIn a journey of repeated leaps and descents, you ascend slowly into the sky, like a brush tracing on paper.\nTENSEI offers you a moment to leave your busy daily life behind and become mindless.\n\nPlay features\n[A unique play feel with a sense of floating in low gravity].\nProject your consciousness into the game and immerse yourself in the game while relaxing.\n\n[Cleansing of distractions]\nDamage zones can be purified by applying a drop (plunge).\nConcentrate on your aim and aim high to avoid damage.\n\n[Become a majestic dragon].\nUse the 3-step jump to collect orbs (drops of ink) on the field while jumping from one scaffold to another.
