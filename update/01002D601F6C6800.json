Fuel your moves with the electric power of music on this unforgiving planet by using real-time execution of moves in rhythm game style!

Her purpose is to serve in the lowest caste for the prosperity of Saturn, but B0B0 doesn't quite agree to that. Amidst a revolution against the Saturnian Satellites, the ultimate form of law, B0B0 hears news of a newfound music robot that'll fit right in her illegal band as a drummer. Rebelling against the corrupt system using music is the only thing she knows how to do well and she only needed a drummer to join her pack of misfits.
