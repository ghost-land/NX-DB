So tell me, rookie, do you have what it takes to achieve ultimate galactic dominance?\n\nBECOME THE BEST SPACE COMMANDER OUT THERE:\n\n• Buy fighters, bombers, and transporters, customize them according to your needs, and build the biggest space fleet around.\n\n• Pursue a mercenary, trader, or mobster career depending on your personal preferences and play style.\n\n• Explore the furthest corners of the galaxy thanks to the in-game expanse module generating countless star systems waiting for your discovery.\n\n• Get involved in a corporate war or fight aliens in multiple, diversified campaign scenarios.",
