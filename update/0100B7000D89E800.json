    "description": "You’ll play as Nessa & Demelza as they explore an ancient island with their pet goose Captain Honkers, riding and upgrading their bikes on a quest for answers.\n\nAs the story unfolds they’ll face hazards, puzzles, and the gathering forces of an ancient curse with their growing collection of frisbees, water-balloons, toilet-plungers, and a boom-box loud enough to wake the undead.\n \nTogether our heroines will laugh, learn, and cry - but will the power of their friendship be enough to actually save the island AND each other?",
