    "description": "Game of the Year 2023 - Thinky Games\n\nThe puzzles in this game are an exploration of how far the interactions between a seemingly simple collection of objects can be taken.

Every puzzle introduces a new idea or interaction.\n• An interactive over world connects the puzzle stages together and holds puzzles of its own.\n• Unlimited undos and restarts.\n• A playable hint system. Every stage has an optional alternative mini-stage designed to tease out the key insight required to solve that puzzle.\n\nAccessibility notes\n\n• No time critical inputs are required.\n• No simultaneous button presses are required.\n• Hearing impaired friendly.\n• Colorblind friendly.",
