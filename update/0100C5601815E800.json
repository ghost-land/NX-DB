    "description": "Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition, the definitive release of the cult classic FPS by original developer and publisher Apogee Entertainment, the maniacal minds at New Blood Interactive, and the gaming treasure hunters at Nightdive Studios, is now available on Nintendo Switch™ for the very first time!\n\nWhen cultists target Los Angeles for destruction, only the High-Risk United Nations Task-Force (codenamed H.U.N.T.) can end their reign of terror. Gear up and load out as one of five elite operatives, each with their own attributes, and infiltrate the cult monastery to stop their nefarious plans.\n\nDive deep into ROTT lore with 4 full campaign modes and expansion packs, and explore never-before-seen content from previously-lost beta builds.  Run and gun through labyrinthine levels and splatter LUDICROUS GIBS across the island with over-the-top weapons. Double the fun with the gaming world’s first-ever dual-wield pistol setup, or blast the iconic Drunk Missile and watch rockets trail off with a mind of their own. Mix things up with magical weapons like the legendary Excalibat, and delete foes in the blink of an eye with the Hand of God. \n\nExperience a perfect mix of past and present with 60+ frames-per-second gameplay, classic pixelated artwork upscaled to HD resolutions, increased field-of-view, cloud saves, achievements, and more.  Recreate any Rise of the Triad experience with multiple iterations of the classic original soundscape, or rock out to the heavy metal 2013 reboot soundtrack  Get the upper hand on enemies with the inclusion of ROTT’s original cheat codes - if you can remember them!",
