In your moment of clarity, you fire a shot into one of the oncoming projectiles and duck under the others. You take a brief moment to catch your breath before repaying your opponents with a flurry of your own shots.”\nThe Geekly Grind\n\n“Narrowly dodging impromptu bullet-hell attacks looks and feels friggin’ sweet.”\nNINTENDO ENTHUSIAST\n\n“A great start to a great party.”\nNintendo World Report",
