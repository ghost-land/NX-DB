    "description": "Maiden & Spell is a one-on-one magical girl aerial projectile battler, featuring a colorful cast of ladies fighting with fantastic spells.\n\nBattling with magic is simple! Fire your spells, hit your opponent, and don't get hit yourself! Each maiden is color-coded and has a set of abilities unique to them, activated at a press of a button. There aren't any complicated combos or intricate inputs or grabs or melee attacks or block buttons! Just a 3-pixels-wide hitbox, a lot of shiny bullets, and your own dodging skills.\n\nYou can fight against a friend in Versus Mode, or test your skill against a series of opponents and bullet hell boss attacks in Story Mode.",
