    "description": "In the future, giant city-states have emerged, separated from each other by indestructible barriers. Most professions have been taken over by machines. People work mainly as mechanics, programmers or operators.\n\n\nSplit is a first-person puzzle game with the unique mechanics of creating copies of yourself and manipulating time. The gameplay combines many different types of puzzles from more and less famous puzzle games and takes them to a whole new perspective.\n\nAfter the recent war, engineers from Epsilon Energy created the Split indestructible shield system. It was to protect individual giant cities covering almost the entire planet from armed conflicts. Different cities have different policies for their citizens. In West Ulrage, every citizen gets a guardian robot at birth. In Hal'Tor, pairs of robots raise several children each. Whereas in Dievez, people are raised in large centers. Most jobs have been taken over by machines. People work mainly as mechanics, programmers, or operators.\n\nThe Split control panel is riddled with numerous traps that will require both good reflexes and composure. You can try to destroy enemies or escape from them by using time manipulation and your own clones to distract them.\n\nThe game's design refers to Brutalism, an architectural style popular around the 1970s. The levels are full of nooks and crannies, which may seem empty at first glance, but lead to interesting places.",
