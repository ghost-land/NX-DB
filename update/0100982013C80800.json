Therefore, you have to make a wise (and sometimes not so) choice that will determine your fate!\n- Become a robber or a decent trader?\n- Beg for money or learning a craft?\n- Take the side of superstitious peasants or to protect the innocent witch?\nAnd this is only a small part of the decisions that you will make on the way from a simple peasant to a nobleman. Are you ready to set off on a dangerous adventure and discover the secret of the kingdom? ",
