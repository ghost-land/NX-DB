    "description": "“Stories Untold” is a narrative-driven experimental adventure game, that bends the genre into something completely unique. Combining a mix of classic text-adventure, point-and-click and more, 4 short stories are packaged together into a single mysterious anthology that has been described as “a fantastic, fascinating example of interactive visual storytelling”  (Telegraph 5/5) and earning widespread critical acclaim since release.\n \nThe game pulls together 80s retro nostalgia, innovative and experimental genre-defying gameplay, and tense, phycological horror to create “one of the most fascinating and unique tales you can play this year” (GameSpew 9/10). \n\n“Stories Untold” was developed by No Code, a Glasgow based ex-AAA development team headed up by Jon McKellan (Alien: Isolation) and Omar Khan.\n\nFeatures:\n\n - Four unique stories, with their own settings, gameplay and mechanics.\n\n - Play mind-bending text adventures, process radio transmissions and conduct experiments on bizarre artifacts.\n\n - Gorgeous retro-aesthetic brings back vivid memories, or a glimpse into what was.\n\n - Sublime synth-wave horror soundtrack, inspired by 80s horror soundtracks.\n\n - Genre-hopping: from psychological horror, to tense mystery and terrifying sci-fi; Stories Untold is truly “4 stories, 1 nightmare”.",
