Choose your favorite Divine Skills to create your very own playstyle. By activating a Divine Skill at just the right moment, you can knock down an enemy, leaving them wide open for massive damage.\n\n◆Use skill points to make a character build all your own\nGive yourself the advantage in battle by upgrading your character’s stats with your weapon’s strengths in mind. Focusing on specific stats and creating a strength, skill, or magic build can also help you gain the upper hand.\n\n◆Complete quests and reap the rewards\nEarn rewards that will help you grow stronger and see stories unfold by completing quests given by a diverse cast of characters. Certain quests will require you to slay powerful, mutated enemies, and defeating them will earn you even greater rewards.\n\n◆Craft items for an advantage when exploring\nWhen you run low on healing items or status effects start to hold you back, that’s  when you should cultivate plants and go fishing to get crafting materials! Even if you find yourself struggling in combat, with the right preparation, you can get through it. Throughout the sanctuaries, you will find hidden items that will help you on your adventure, so if something catches your eye, check it out. It just might be something good.",
