    "description": "This is a simple and fun game. In the game, you play as a member of a transport convoy, carving a bloody path through monsters and robbers. They are after your cargo, and you must turn them into your spoils of war with the weapons in your hands.\n\n+ Multiple characters are available for selection, each with different physical abilities and bullet types, and you can choose one different skill to create diverse tactics with hundreds of construction combinations.\n\n+ Various types of enemies continuously approach you, and the exhilarating rhythm quickly immerses you in the battle state.\n\n+ Choose from various constructions to enhance your own stats, bullet strength, and build defense towers.\n\n+ Defeat the boss to obtain powerful treasures, but sometimes they also summon many minions.",
