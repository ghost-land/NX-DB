Sneak out late, make new friends, uncover hidden truths, and collect words that will change the course of fate!\n\nREWRITE PAST EVENTS BY USING CHARMS\nWhile helping Luka investigate the strange goings-on in Beacon Pines, you’ll collect special golden charms, each with a word engraved on it. These charms can be used at certain turning points in the story to fill in a blank word and drastically change everything that follows.\n\nDISCOVER DIFFERENT STORY PATHS\nAs the book's reader, you’ll navigate the story’s turning points using The Chronicle: an interactive story tree that branches and grows along with your choices. Exploring one set of events can unlock new charms to use on another branch, leading you to jump back and forth between entirely different versions of the story in order to unravel the mysteries at the heart of Beacon Pines.",
