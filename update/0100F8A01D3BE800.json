    "description": "Your fellow rabbits don't have any plans for the night. They're all about stargazing and occasionally hopping over one another. Which one is the last one to go home?\n\nCosmic Hare is a casual puzzle game based on the classic board game ‘Peg Solitaire’: Pieces can be moved by jumping over adjacent pieces, and the goal is to remove all but the last piece from the board. In this version the pieces come to life as adorable rabbits, and the board expands to a multidimensional universe with rules of its own for you to discover.",
