    "description": "Travel through the kingdom and its different regions in this 3D adventure inspired by late 90s games. Explore each region freely, uncover their secrets, and save your bear friends! This realm was once a peaceful place, until the bees started producing purple honey, a strange substance that turns anyone who eats it into a mindless foe. You will play as Baaren, a courageous bear set on a quest to free the kingdom from this menace of unknown origin.\n\nAlong the way, you will find loads of collectibles, items to customize your character, exciting places to explore, speedy vehicles to drive, daily challenges to test your skills, and fun mini-games to play. Using Baarenâ€™s straightforward yet complete set of moves, you will be able to climb steep mountains, fight dangerous enemies, and explore this world packed with surprises.",
