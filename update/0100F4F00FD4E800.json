You can carry the fight with the Hero and act as a shield, while the Witch is physically weak but capable of using powerful magic. Only by combining the abilities of both characters will you succeed.\n\nEventually you earn a ‘one-shot’ magical power to turn the tide of the toughest battles!\n\nContinue the adventure that began in Witch & Hero and try to conquer the Demon Lord!",
