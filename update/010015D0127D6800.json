    "description": "In a universe, dimensions are connected to each other.\nIn the center of the passages lies Dimensional Core, keeping the balance between dimensions.\n\nThis balance began to collapse when the Core stopped working.\nUnless someone gives a helping hand, soon the universe will follow.\n\nThe Gate doesn't let anyone into the Dimensional Core.\nBut Quby, as the last descendant of Chosen Ones, can access the Gate.\n\nTo restore the balance between dimensions, Quby opens a portal to the Gate.\nWith Varon, the talking penguin, she must explore the long-forgotten ruins of her ancestors and find a way to reactivate the Core.\nLet the journey begin!",
