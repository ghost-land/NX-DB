    "description": "Create your own star student and attend a schedule full of classes in time to gather the knowledge you need to graduate. With hundreds of other students walking the halls, an equally important popularity contest challenges you to survive long enough to thrive! \n\nEnvisaged in 3D for the first time, there are dozens of locations to roam inside and outside of school - as well as an abundance of fully interactive props to get you through the day. You can also fine-tune the camera to enjoy the action from a variety of different angles.\n\nChoose from hundreds of preset characters of any age, or save your changes to every character in the editor to make the world your own. Just when you think you've seen it all, a whole other career as a teacher awaits - which challenges you to impart knowledge as successfully as you learnt it! Whenever you need the support of friends, other controllers can join the action at any moment to help or hinder.",
