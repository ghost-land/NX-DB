    "description": "Cosmic Defenders is a 2D fast-paced revolving shooter about a group of unconventional heroes who use the powers of nature in order to stop chaotic aliens from taking over the universe. Cooperate with other guardians, protect the galaxy from the wicked, and restore peace in three game modes: Story Mode, Survival Mode, and Versus Mode.\n \nTake on these spaced-out invaders by yourself, or with some friends! Choose from 4 different characters, each with their own unique abilities! Can you bring peace to the cosmos?\n \n• Story mode introduces the Cosmic Defenders as they fight against a group of aliens that want to steal the Tree of Life, a sacred tree that maintains the balance in the universe. Advance through levels over 4 galaxies, each with unique challenges and ways to play! \n• Survival mode lets you enjoy new levels every time they play! Collect coins to purchase outfits with skill buffs!\n• Versus mode lets you compete against your friends, rather than aliens, because Defenders need to train too!",
