    "description": "Find yourself in a future city full of gangs, mafias, and other shady people. Become a merciless assassin who works during the day, and gets into a killing frenzy at night. Hop in the car, select a destination, and explore every corner of Crimson Tide.\n\nIf you want to feel an adrenaline rush, you can explore the city on foot but watch your back and don’t ask too many questions.\n\n\nEVERYTHING CAN BE A WEAPON!\nSearch your surroundings for anything that looks deadly and use it to protect yourself. Throw bottles, knives, or even guns at the enemies. \n\nNothing around you? \n\nTake some pills and breach doors to stun opponents, or just disarm them by kicking their faces. They will be pleased to drop a weapon for you then. You should definitely find and lick a frog – you will love it.\n\n\nPLAN YOUR ATTACK\nIt’s your decision how to enter combat and how to end it. Find your first victim, and go with the flow. Try every possibility and find the best way to get the highest score. \n\nKick an enemy while sliding to pick his weapon mid-air and land a headshot to defeat him. Creativity is the key to success. \n\n\nCREATE YOUR OWN STORY\nThere are 12 available endings waiting for you to be discovered. Each one takes around 4 hours for hardcore players to complete. The path you choose will never be completely the same next time. Also, check and search for collectibles that are hidden all over the city. \n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- 4 difficulty levels\n- Multiple possibilities of approach\n- Aim assist – if you need a little help\n- Retro-styled graphics\n- Entertaining soundtrack to keep combat exciting\n- Your own apartment with a retro console full of mini-games",
