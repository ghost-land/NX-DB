    "description": "What's love got to do with it? In this divine romantic comedy, play as Lynette Mirror, Cupid Corporation's top bridal advisor and none other than Celestia's Goddess of Love, Cupid! Determined to prove that love is more than bows and arrows, she meets her biggest challenge yet - the infamous Parasite 5.\n\nBut in finding love for the Parasite 5, will Cupid find love herself?\n\nKey Features\n\nFrom Boys to Men  – Help the Parasite 5 find true love through \"practice dates\" to prepare them for their future partners. Maybe you'll find your true love along the way?\n\nAre U That Somebody? – Find your ideal love type through the dating questionnaire! Each Parasite 5 member has a different love type, which means the partner you end up with will depend on the results of the questionnaire. Want to explore the different love types? New Game+ allows players to manually select your character route, and may even unlock more love connections...\n\nFirst Comes Love, Then Comes Marriage – The answers you choose during story choices can increase your Love Level with a character. If a character likes your answer, you'll experience a Love Surge. You can take the difficulty up a notch by turning off the Love Surge animations in the menu. A specific Love Level is needed to get a route's true ending!\n\nGo With The Flow – A Flow Chart is available to keep track of story progression. Hop to and from already experienced scenes to revisit your story choices. Use the Flow Chart to re-do routes and/or relive any memorable scenes!\n",
