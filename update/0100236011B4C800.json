There’s a whole wide-open frontier full of exciting quests and wildlife to explore. With Lucky’s fearless best friends Abigail and Pru by your side, you’re bound to have lots of fun! \n\nYou’ll need to navigate dangers too, like the horse wrangler Hendricks, who’s a little too interested in your treasure hunt.
