    "description": "The year is 2145. Earth still burns. Zallagor and his army have been vanquished, but at great cost: the once great cities of Earth lie in ruin, its population hungry for revenge.\n\nZallagor’s home planet of Zerkl has been located. Zallagor has gone, but somebody will rise to replace him. Maybe they already have. The Destructivator is ready – it is time to strike!\n\nTake on the role of a tiny super-solider decked out in lime green spandex! Blast and melee your way through hordes of alien soldiers, robots, spaceships, traps, bosses – and more! Fight on foot or commandeer an enemy ship to take out Zerkl’s defenses and ensure that the alien menace won't threaten Earth ever again.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- 50+ challenging stages set across six epic missions!\n- A vast array of enemies to blast to pieces!\n- Bosses and frequent mini boss fights!\n- Steal enemy ships and attack from the air!\n- Wear a hideous lime green suit!\n- Normal, Hard, and Brutal skill levels!\n- Unapologetically old-school!",
