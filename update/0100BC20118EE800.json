    "description": "Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game where players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten and explodes!\n\nPlay your cards to try to avoid, move, or defuse the Exploding Kitten. If you don't explode, you win! Congratulations, you are full of greatness.\n\nPlay with friends in the same room or online, or play with strangers in online play. Not into other people? Play single player against kitty-bot opponents! \n\nThis version of the game includes the Streaking Kittens, Party Pack, Betrayal Pack, and Barking Kittens expansions, exclusive cards, and hilarious illustrations by The Oatmeal.  \n\nWith millions of games sold and downloaded, Exploding Kittens is the perfect card game for players of all ages who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats. \n\n\"It's like UNO, except there are goats, magical enchiladas and kittens that can kill you.\" -CNN",
