    "description": "Long ago, a war raged between two powerful deities. The conflict endured until each was sealed into the great unknown, scattering their Godly weapons across the world. These lost weapons - now known as \"Furies\" - are highly prized by warriors who call themselves \"Fencers\" and it is said that whoever collects a Fury shall be granted one wish. By chance, a young man named Fang pulls a Fury from a stone and inadvertently becomes a Fencer himself. Now he must choose which deity to awaken!\n\nKey Features\n• In the three stories to play, friends become foes, foes become friends and, based on your choices, multiple endings can be unlocked!\n• Customize weapons by fusing them with fairies and alter dungeons through World-Shaping. Even transform with the “Fairize” skill and become stronger in battle!\n• With up to six party members on the battlefield at a time, you can play as all your favorite Fencers!\n• Play in Easy, Normal, or Hard mode and switch the difficulty to suit your play style!\n",
