Enjoy the heroic(?) strategies of all five!\n\nThe Tension Bonus System (TBS) means your score and number of coins multiplies based on your  distance from enemies and their attacks, and the Powershot System changes normal attacks into strong attacks, further ramping up the tension!\nPlus, once the TBS has multiplied by two within a certain time, Secret Fairies will be hidden somewhere in stages for you to find.\n\nMaster these systems and set new high scores!\n\nOnline ranking system (Please ensure you're connected to the internet).",
