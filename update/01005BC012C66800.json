There have never been so many customisation options to choose from!\n\n\nEXPLORE A HUGE NEW WORLD\n\nWhat would an adventure be without an enormous area to explore?! Discover new places, new ducks to compete with and new shops across an expansive overworld. In fact, this is the biggest world in any Duck Life game yet!\n\n\nTRAIN YOUR DUCK IN 8 SKILLS\n\nThis time, your duck can both race AND battle other ducks.

Take them on with 25 new weapons, new power ups and new abilities. Train strength to improve your attack power, health to increase your hitpoints and jumping to gain the ability to dodge attacks!\n\n\nCOMPLETE ALL 25 QUESTS\n\nThere are ducks in need, and only you can help them!
