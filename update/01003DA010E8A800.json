You may hear some hot gossip on grandma or find your best friend and mom doing pushups! Characters may also learn skills like “lend a hand” and help each other out during battle. Outings let you send character pairs on bonding experiences at the beach, a café, and more. Even your trusty horse can lend a hoof.\n\nBring your friends into battle\n\nEngage in turn-based combat against outlandish baddies like the gyrating Twerkey to gain experience and level up characters.
