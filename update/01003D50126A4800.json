    "description": "Sumire is an indie narrative adventure, featuring a one-day journey through a picturesque Japanese village. In this enchanted place, a disenchanted girl named Sumire meets a mischievous spirit who makes her a deal to fulfill her most desired wish.\nBut in order to see this wish come true, she must complete a series of tasks in return, before night falls and this special day reaches its end.\n\n■ Follow Sumire on a series of quests both big and small, given by charming forest creatures, quirky townspeople, and Sumire's own heartfelt needs.\n■ Take or refuse them, but be wary: as the day progresses, your path will change and you may never get the same chance again.\n■ Discover collectibles, bonus items, tests of skill, and other challenges -- some hidden, some not.\n■ Explore a variety of lush, beautiful environments rendered in a painterly style.\n■ A one day time limit. With the sky changing from the promise of morning to the soft twilight, all choices are finished when the sky turns to violet.",
