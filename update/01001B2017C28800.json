Years later, four high school friends attend an academy in a rural town called Matsudo. As members of the newspaper club, they aim to boost the local area by uploading videos.

While investigating an old well, they uncover a new truth and gradually approach the incident's truth. However, they don't realize something strange is happening to them too.
