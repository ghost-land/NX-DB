    "description": "Set on 17th-century British colonial Mars, Jamestown+ is a neoclassical cooperative shoot-em-up for up to four players. Lush pixelart and an award-winning orchestral soundtrack immerse you in Raleigh’s battle to protect Britain’s last bastion: Jamestown colony. It's designed to be an exciting experience whether this is your first shoot 'em up or your hundredth!\n\nJamestown+ features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay.\n\nJamestown's wide array of difficulty levels gives newcomers an exciting way to get into the shoot 'em up genre while also offering experts the crisp controls and intense action they crave.\n\nJamestown+ plays beautifully with any number of players - you'll only lose a credit when the whole team is destroyed at once, so you're always happy to have a bonus friend in on the action!",
