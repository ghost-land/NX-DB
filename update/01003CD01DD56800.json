    "description": "Explore randomly generated card dungeons where you can only move Right and Down, use Dice to defeat mighty enemies, gather powerful artifacts, and learn new abilities! Will you be able to escape from the dungeon?\n\nEach dungeon is randomly generated, so each game is unique! On each turn, the only decision you can make is to go right or down! Explore the card dungeon and fight against mighty enemies, get blessings in the sacred shrines, or buy new powerful artifacts from the shopkeeper!\n\nEach time you move to a new encounter card, you have to use your dice! The battle is divided in turns. In the player's turn, roll the dice and place them on the enemies to defeat them! You can also place the dice in your skills to obtain different effects, like rolling more dice or healing yourself. But be careful, in the enemy's turn they will attack you and activate their skills!\n\n*Unlock 6 heroes with different starting artifacts and skills to create your custom run!\n*More than 100 artifacts with a wide variety of effects that you can unlock with every game you play!\n*30 different dungeons. Each one adds a new rule to the game and will increase its difficulty!\n*Daily Mode with randomly generated conditions!",
