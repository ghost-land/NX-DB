You will work hard for the public good and help thousands of citizens. Your efforts won't go unnoticed. In fact, the Wise Leader himself will decorate you with official honors!\n \nYet...\nYou are not going to dust off the applications of insignificant citizens, are you? No, pushing papers is not your cup of tea! Your goal is the Prime Minister's seat! You'll get there, too, and destroy anyone who dares to stand in your way! Scheming and blackmailing are just the tip of the iceberg – and the ends justify the means!\n \nBut…\nHow did you end up here? Could you have landed this job on your own? No, that would have been next to impossible! So, who sent you and – more importantly – why?\n \nThey want what?? NO!! No one can know this!
