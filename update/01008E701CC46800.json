    "description": "Your ball drops like a brick through colorful helix platforms that block its descent, but if you hit a red spot, it's over! Your ball shatters to pieces and you have to start your fall all over again. \n\nEven traps platforms are no match for a fireball falling at full speed! Choose your strategy: speed up like a madman or stop and wait for your next chance to roll and jump!\n\nIf you don't want to play solo, choose a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players and compete with your friends or family. Together, pick one of the three different gameplay modes with special challenges: get the highest score while avoiding getting minus points, be the first at the finish line, or go as far as you can in a limited time! Reveal who is the fastest and most agile jumping ball among you!\n\nThe key is mastering your reflexes and looking ahead. To guide the bouncing ball, rotate the platforms to align the ball with the cracks. Do this in quick succession for a combo move and higher points. If you pass 3 levels consecutively, you'll be invincible for the first bounce after!\n\nFeatures:\n- drop your ball with crazy fast speed and make your way through helix platforms\n- face your friends or family in multiplayer mode for up to 4 players with 3 different gameplay modes!\n- practice your reflexes and break your best scores\n- see how many levels you can complete in this never-ending game\n- defeat bosses on levels with obstacles like switches and metal platforms that not even a fireball falling at full speed can destroy\n- customize your ball with variety of funny skins \n- invite anyone to play thanks to easy controls and simple rules\n- never get bored thanks to this amazing time killer!\n\nJump into never ending adventure with unlimited levels, test your skills and invite others to have fun together!",
