    "description": "Most states did not survive the third world war. The borders between them were erased, and a unified form of government was established on the planet - Corporatocracy, which put power over people in the hands of cold-blooded boards of directors of transnational companies.\nThe bloody war left a heavy mark on all of mankind, creating millions of useless cripples, one of which is the hero of this visual short story.\nIn the post-war reality, people like him have no future. Nevertheless, he's given a unique chance - to start all over again in the experimental version of a virtual reality full immersion.\nInvoluntarily, he becomes a participant in an ambitious experiment, the OMNIMUS. In the beginning, everything is going well, but gradually the events begin to take on a completely unexpected turn.\n\nFeatures:\n• Player's decisions have consequences.\n• Two romanceable characters.\n• Several endings.\n• Beautiful CG and original music.",
