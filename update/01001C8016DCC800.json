Experience challenges and adventures by working together, but still competing with one another, in single-player or four-player team modes. Players will be equipped with different types of cards and work together to become the best team of little monster warriors.\n\nGame where players can choose a team of 1 to 4 little monsters to go on an adventure.

Test your bodyâ€™s reflexes and balance as you break through enemy formations, dodge killer moves, deliver attacks, overcome obstacles, and more.\n\nEasy to Use/Diverse Challenges\nMonster Fruit Academy allows everyone to pick up the game quickly and have fun together, but in order for players to protect themselves during the chaos of battle, they must organize themselves and make the best out of their limited cards. Only a well-prepared and coordinated team can save the monster world and become the best team of little monsters.\n\nDifferent Gaming Modes\nAs the game progresses, a number of special challenge levels will be revealed. You can compete with your teammates to get the best score and become the MVP of the game.\n\nUse Card Combos to Work and Have Adventures with Friends\nMonster Fruit Academy has 73 cards with five different functions. At the beginning of the game, players can choose whether to equip themselves with the cards or to obtain and use them randomly throughout the game, gradually collecting the whole set of cards as they progress in the story.\n",
