What else anyone would want in a retro arcade game?\n\nAmazing music\nIf you love 1980s then you definitely love good music. We’ve got professional soundtrack for you from a great synthwave artist - Beckett. That’s why we recommend you play with headphones to have a fully immersive experience.\n\nCharismatic characters\nKevin: a typical 80s kid who mutated and gained superpowers\nBuddy: best dog companion you've ever had (also very cute)\nFriends: save your friends Joy, Darryl and Ben and they will help you on your dangerous journey.\n\nDifferent modes\nNormal mode: fun, challenging and addictive but not the hardest game ever.\nHardcore mode: run, survive, test your reflexes (the way arcade is supposed to be played).\nRage mode: what others call zen we call rage, let your inner anger out!\n\nAbout Top Run:\nTop Run was developed by a family of two people who adores 80s and wanted to create a fun game for adults who are nostalgic about 1980s and a game for kids who love addictive and challenging action.",
