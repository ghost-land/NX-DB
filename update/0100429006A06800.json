Fool the military and ensure no one stays safe – it’s the Zombiepocalypse, with built-in level editor!\n\nOnce you were a human, like everyone else, but that doesn’t matter anymore. Your sole purpose is simple – eat as many brains as possible and turn everyone into your kind. Become a leader of your horde and infect all the humans on the map.

You can command your horde to attack armed soldiers, infect helpless civilians, follow you, or await orders. Each scenario requires a different tactical approach and careful planning to achieve world domination.\nAnd if you think you’re done after spreading your plague on all campaign levels, it’s time for the next step – I, ZOMBIE’s built- in level editor lets you build your own maps and challenge your skills just the way you like. \n\nI, ZOMBIE MAIN FEATURES\n• Be a zombie, eat brains!\n• Control your minions by simple commands – you might be dead, but who said the dead can’t come up with great strategies?\n• Simple, arcade and puzzle-like rules – be smart, be sneaky, unleash the zombiepocalypse!\n• A comic setting – zombies are cute and funny too!\n• In-game level editor – endless fun, and even more brains!",
