    "description": "It was a fine day in the farm, and Freija was just chatting with his friend Filipo about the upcoming harvest when out of nowhere, a gnome passed by and stole from their barn! Will they let it slide? Not on their watch.\n\nExperience the classic arcade shooter game play with loads of twists in Gnome More War. Deal with incoming gnomes in waves, protect yourself from attacks, and prevent your barn resources from being depleted. Unlock offensive power-ups like Magic Missile, Power Burst, and Wind Boomerang and combine them with defensive power-ups like Barrier, Shell, and Slow Time to aid you in your quest. As you go through each map, you will need to employ a deeper strategy and make use of the unlockable upgrades that can increase your armor, gain more power-up charges over time, or even enlist your goblin friends to assist you. To top it all off, you can also invite a buddy to play as Freija, Nih, or Scarlet in co-op mode.\n\nThis is war!",
