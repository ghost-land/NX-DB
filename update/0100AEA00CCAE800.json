    "description": "A light-hearted and playful puzzle game about working together.\n\nPlay alone controlling both characters or share the experience with a friend. Bleep Bloop is extremely easy to learn, but that doesn't mean the puzzles will be a piece of cake.\n\n- Enough levels to keep you entertained during a lazy Sunday, but not enough to make you wish the game had ended already.\n\n- Beautiful soundtrack that makes getting stuck on a level a bit less painful.\n\n- Perfect for single-player or two-player coop. Yelling at each other doesn't improve your puzzle-solving skills, but it's always fun.\n\n- Features a small secret hidden somewhere. Go look for it.\n",
