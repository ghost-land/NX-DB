    "description": "Character sprites and CGs are made using the E-mote animation system.\nWhen they breathe, wink, or speak, it all looks very realistic.\nMoreover, 2 theme songs sung by Chata and Akira Ouse are included!\nEach character’s lines are fully dubbed in Japanese.\n\nThis is an agonizing wintertime love song.\n\nBroken families,\nExperiences of bullying,\nTears concealed by smiles.\n\nIs the taste of first love sweet or bitter? Who will be redeemed, and who will enter the abyss?\nAttracted, estranged, separated, hurt.\n\nYoung men and women, three encounters, each carries sorrowful secrets in the cold winter.\n\nEmbracing each other and absorbing the earth's final, small bit of warmth.\n\nOpening Theme Song\n「Pure White」\nSinger: Chata\nComposer/Arranger: Meis Clauson\nLyrics: Chata\n\nEnding Theme Song\n「Guilty Snow」\nComposer/Lyrics/Singer: Akira Ouse\nArranger: Kyoya Fujikami",
