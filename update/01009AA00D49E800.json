    "description": "Times are changing, and the existence of the Grimoas has become less relevant in everyday life. The young Eil is in the middle of his Coming-of-Age ceremony when suddenly his town is attacked by a demon and engulfed in flames. In the midst of this confusion, Eil enters into a pact with the Air Grimoa, Nogard, in order to save everyone. \nEil and Nogard set off to look for the demon who cast the town into a sea of flames, and to find other Grimoas in order to put a stop to its violence!\n\nThe game features classic turn-based battles, with a Synchro Gauge system which lets you unleash powerful skills when synchronized with the Grimoas. A wide range of achievements, including quests to complete and items to collect, await you during this epic adventure!",
