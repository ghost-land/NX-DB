    "description": "Home renovation has never been so much fun!\nIt is hard, messy work. But you don’t have to work alone in this crazy couch co-op! Join up to three friends, sit down (or not) and start a wild renovation party!\n\nMeet a crew of renovators eager to get their job done. But most accidents happen at home: can you work effectively when there’s spilled paint on the floor and a pool of lava around the apartment?\n\nPaint walls, tear off wallpapers and follow the blueprints. Lead a building crew and make sure everyone knows their tasks—or don’t cooperate at all. Hear your friends scream in 3, 2, 1...\n\nRace against the clock as you renovate the apartments, chase delivery men and earn a star (or maybe even stars) for each level! Complete tasks to unlock more challenging missions. Hint: teamwork is the key.\n\nLet Tools Up! show you that simple controls and a Party Mode will party up every party! So grab your controllers and remember the first rule of Tools Up!—work hard and play hard!",
