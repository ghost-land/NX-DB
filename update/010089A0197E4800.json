All you can do is survive as long as you can until death inevitably puts an end to your struggles. Gather gold in each run to buy upgrades and help the next survivor.\n\nThe supernatural indie phenomenon that lets you be the bullet hell!\n\nThe whole game is also playable in 1-4 player couch co-op.\n\nStarting Tips:\n- Take your time to grab gems and items, they won't disappear.\n- Get two or three offensive weapons at first, but focus on levelling them up one at a time.\n- Armour and Luck are good starting power-ups to spend money on.\n- Refund power-ups often, it's free, and try new upgrade paths.\n",
