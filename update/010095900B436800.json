    "description": "RemiLore is a “rogue-lite” anime-style adventure set in a colorful fantasy world where players hack-and-slash their way through an army of mechanical monsters using a huge variety of unique melee weapons and devastating magic attacks!\n\nRemi, an ordinary high school student, has awakened Lore, a talking book who is a self-proclaimed “master” of magic. Together, they are drawn into the magical world of Ragnoah, which has been overtaken by nefarious mecha-monsters. Remi and Lore must venture together and find their way home, but can Remi really trust the mischievous magic book Lore? Who is the mysterious android girl “Choux” and why does she want to capture Lore? Will Remi ever find her way out of the magical world and return home?\n\nFeatures single-player story mode with full Japanese voice acting, two-player co-op mode, upgradable spells and bonus traits, and procedurally-generated levels in four beautifully rendered worlds, each based on one of the four seasons. Defeating mecha-monsters has its rewards, too - players can uncover loads of unlockables, including alternate costumes, 200+ collectible weapons, New Game+ modes, and more!",
