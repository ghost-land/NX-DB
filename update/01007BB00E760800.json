    "description": "CROSSNIQ+ (CROSS-neek plus) is a \"y2k aesthetic\" arcade puzzle game, featuring a late 90s-inspired futuristic visual style - and serving up brain-bending, lightning-fast gameplay straight from the golden age of arcade puzzle games!\n\nRearrange your grid of tiles to form “crosses” - a row and column of the same color - to earn points and keep the game going. Speedy clears and multi-crosses will net you bonus points, but be careful... as the difficulty heats up, locked and frozen tiles will push your reflexes to the limit. To become a CROSSNIQ+ champion, you’ll have to master thinking in all directions - even if that means wrapping around the grid!\n\n• Play to your absolute limit in Endless mode, or unleash your fastest and fiercest puzzle skills in Time Attack mode… aim for the top and share your best score with players around the world via online leaderboards!\n\n• Face off against a friend in Versus mode, a chaotic local multiplayer battle with characters, items, special moves, and more! \n\n• Feeling puzzled out? Take a break in Chillout mode. No hazards, no timers, no game overs - simply relax and make crosses at your leisure, all while enjoying a wide variety of vibrant sights and atmospheric sounds.\n\n• Enjoy oodles of in-game unlockables - items, costumes, music, and more!\n\nLet’s Cross! Aim for THE TOP!!",
