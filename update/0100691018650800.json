    "description": "One day, a young farmer. The other day, a hero... \nBut is he really able to save the town if he's barely able to save himself? \n\nAs a local Hero, you will need to explore ancient ruins, defeat an army of evil minions and unravel the mystery of the sinking town, but in fact, it's not the hardest task to fullfill. You will also need to prove the others that you are capable of being taken seriously and that may be the hardest thing to do. \n\nAN EPIC ADVENTURE \nIs it really a tale we've heard thousands of times before? \n\nNERVE-RACKING SWORD FIGHTS \nYou will meet a lot of evil creatures standing in your path - dealing with them is the only way to save the kingdom! \n\nLOADS OF PLATFORMING! \nJumping, climbing and running will be your bread and butter! Who knew that there's such sacrifice involved in being a legendary hero? \n\nA TALE TO REMEMBER \nMemorable characters, great humour, lots of surprising dungeons and puzzles are only a part of this memorable tale. \n\nWill you be the One True Hero this kingdom needs?",
