    "description": "You play as Photon who, after another sell-out gig, has once again asserted his galactic lyrical dominance. He gets word his friend Gamma-Boi is organizing the ultimate after-party in his honor. However, it is not going to be easy to reach. The other musical artists want a shot at the top and will do anything to get there. However, to Photon, they are just Haters. Space Haters. It is up to Photon to blast through the so-called \"Monarchs of Music\" and reach the afterparty of the light-year, and of course, look good whilst doing it",
