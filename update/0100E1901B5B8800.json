    "description": "Johnny Trigger returns in a sequel that shakes up the sniper game genre. All the action, no lurking, tedious waiting or stress: pick a target, take aim, shoot and pick another target.\n\nYou play as a professional assassin with style, guts and an awesome rifle. Your opponents aren't beaten in the dark either and they can bite back, but you've got enough bullets in your magazine: pick a target, aim, headshot! Way to go!\n\nEarn money for missions to unlock new guns, rocket launchers and even assault rifles. Collect keys to open mysterious suitcases. Shoot exploding barrels, defeat mafia bosses and make sure innocent civilians don't get hurt. \n\nBecome the best sniper and show everyone that you deserve your name!",
