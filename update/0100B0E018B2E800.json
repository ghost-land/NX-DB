    "description": "One of the most unusual Supaplex of all! Its levels are in the shape of small squares on the game board. The whole square is entirely visible and the level does not imply long passing. However, each of them will require quick thinking and fast reactions! On the whole, this game doesn't contain very large and complex elements and can be used by beginners of the SUPAPLEX world. But at the same time we think it may be of interest to professionals! In total we can say - it's a game of UNUSUAL SQUARE LEVELS!\n\n- 111 INCREDIBLY EXCITING LEVELS! Help Murphy beat them all! Collect Infotrons, dodge Zonks, escape from Snik-Snaks, and smash Electrons!\n\n- THE ORIGINAL SUPAPLEX GAMING ENGINE! Superbly fine-tuned real Supaplex logic! Lots of hidden features! Experiment and find new ones!\n\n- INSTANT LEVEL SAVING! SCROLL AND ZOOM IN & OUT OF THE GAME BOARD! THREE SPEEDS! Hone your tactical skills!
