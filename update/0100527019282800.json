Stella decides to step out into that dark, ominous hallway in order to find out where she is and whatâ€™s happening here.\n\nStella must explore each wing of the hospital, surviving the life-threatening trials that await her. As she does, she will learn why she was brought here and all the secrets this facility is hiding...\n\nSavior of the Abyss is a horror adventure game in the RPG maker style, created by Korean indie game dev ALLAUGH GAMES. This game stands apart from others in this style by focusing on Cthulhu-centered Lovecraftian elements, bringing them to a present day setting. The story deals with the horror humans feel when confronted by beings and monsters beyond their imagination that they have no power to resist.\n\nOur protagonist, Stella, must find out why she was confined in an old hospital basement and make her escape, discovering the secrets of the facility along the way. Players must help her escape from the ominous perils of the prison by acquiring and using various items, all while protecting Stella from the life-threatening dangers she will face.\n\n- Death lurks around every corner. Don't face it head-on, and don't let your guard down.\n- Collect and use the tools you can find to survive.\n- Items can act as clues to help you escape, but can be fatal if used carelessly, so use them wisely.\n- Each choice is a fork in the road. If you manage to survive, you may see which of three endings you have attained.",
