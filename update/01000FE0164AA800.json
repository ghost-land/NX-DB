    "description": "MAXIMUS 2 is a fantasy beat-em-up (brawler) that focuses on crunchy and satisfying combat. We captured the spirit of some of the best classic beat-em-ups, melding them into one memorable experience. Fight solo or with up to 4 players cooperative multiplayer!\n\nSTORY Is a single, continuous shot. This hasnâ€™t been done since the 80's, rather than simply cutting from one stage to the next, the players enter an animated transition to the next area, creating the illusion of a fantastic journey.\n\nMULTIPLAYER co-op in real time, fight together with up to 4 players online or on the same device with supported Bluetooth controllers.\n\nHEROES with their own roles and weapons.  The tank, the wrestler, the magician, the outlaw, the healer and the ninja.\n\nTEAMWORK If you work together, you survive. Players can revive a fallen teammate, support or heal them and gang up to juggle enemies off each other in the air.",
