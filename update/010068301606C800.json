There are also brand-new collection items to find!\n\n[Story]\nOur story begins with Minato arriving in the small town of Kagami, an exceptionally ordinary sort of place in a sleepy suburb of Tokyo.\n\nBut there's more to this simple trip than meets the eye. Minato has a secret objective: he intends to find his missing father, who is supposedly living somewhere in the area.\nOur young sleuth Minato wastes no time getting started, and soon finds a puzzling clue to his father's whereabouts. A mysterious notebook left for him with the portentous title \"The Seven Mysteries.\"\n\nWith this notebook as his guide, Minato sets out on a long and difficult journey, not through space, but through time. For his destination is none other than 33 years in the past—the day his father and mother first met!",
