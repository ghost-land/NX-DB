    "description": "・You're a treasure hunter who's crash-landed on a remote desert island. \nCan you overcome a relentless gauntlet of pinches and traps and safely escape the island…?!\n\n・The only controls used in the game are movement (D-Pad/L-Stick) and the A and B buttons!\nAll kinds of terrain, traps, and enemies will stand in your way, but as the player, please do your best to figure out all the maneuvers and ways of getting out of each pinch!\n\n・This game features a replay function that allows all play during the game to be recorded and replayed later on. An online ranking system in which all players can compete with clear-times globally is also featured.\n\n・While preserving the game’s core fun as is, we’ve enhanced the playability of the new and improved “50 Pinch Barrage!” in certain areas based on the original version’s stages. We’ve also improved the game’s graphics, and it's overall easier to play now!",
