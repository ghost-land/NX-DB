    "description": "Serial Cleaners is a top-down stealth-action game, where you get to experience being a murder scene cleaner for the mob in 1990s New York. \n\nGet rid of the bodies, make the place spotless, and don't get caught. Plan every step and move like a ghost or trust your reflexes and thrive in chaos. The choice is yours. \n\nAlternate between four characters, each with a unique skill set opening up new possibilities. \n\nSerial Cleaners’ setting—inspired by cult ‘90s movies—will bring back fond memories of the more carefree decade, full of brightly colored optimism... and the grime underneath it all.\n",
