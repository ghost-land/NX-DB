Kill.\n\nAtomicrops is an action roguelite farming simulator.

Defend your land from the mutant pests and bandits that invade nightly to ravage your fields. Court and wed townsfolk to fight and farm by your side. Gather upgrades to increase yields, profit and power. Befriend the local wildlife to help with the chores.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nFARM.
