But with the competition so fierce, you and your partner will need to hone your co-operative tactics to become champions of the stars.\n\nHow will you collaborate? What's your game plan?\nWill you outwit your opponents and emerge victorious, as the team in possession of the fabled chicken?\n\nIt's time to go clucking wildâ€¦\n\nIt's not easy being a professional chicken-catcher. You'll need to communicate to trick and flee your enemies. Cooperation is the key to success!\n\n- The Rider:\nAs a gleeful Twelvian Rider, you'll jump and glide in the air, and are more than a little handy witha weapon. But when you're in possession of the chicken, your powers are limited. Pass the chicken to your Mount to regain your agility!\n\n- The Mount: \nThis little piggy sure packs a punch. Charge, attack, accelerate, and activate triggers - but when you've got the chicken, you're rendered far less deadly. Pass the chicken to your Rider to blitz your opponents once more!\n\nIn the future, chicken-catchers can play from anywhere they like!\n\n- ONLINE:\nChallenge your friends to a private game, or join the rest of the galaxy to compete for supremacy!\n\n- SPLIT-SCREEN:\nGather up to four friends and ride your buddies during frantic couch co-op parties!\n\n- SOLO:\nPrepare for competition with training races and other solo challenges!\n\nAND MORE!\n\n- An array of colorful arenas, each with its own set of special features!\n- Cosmetic customization: spend your winnings and become a recognizable celebrity chicken-catcher!",
