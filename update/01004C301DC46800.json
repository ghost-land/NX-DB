We watched the skies, assuming any new enemies would come from above—which is why we were surprised when the supermassive \"Gaiarch\" emerged from below ground, shattering the Earth into pieces. YOU are the legendary Commander that once saved our planet. Now, we need you to lead another team to save our Earth again. The EDF never back away from defending the Earth, be it round or square—so let's go to the rescue!",
