    "description": "Keep the line moving! Chaotically assemble the most efficient conveyor belts to keep the goods flowing out of the factory! Use various tools and equipment to overcome the ever-increasing challenges and goods the factory throws at you. Best played in 2-player couch coop but also supports single-player. \n\nMultiple Tools, Various Solutions\n\nYour job is simple - rebuild the conveyor belts and get the goods flowing out of the factory. As you progress youâ€™ll be given all manner of tools, equipment, and conveyor parts to overcome obstacles. Forklifts, cranes, springboard conveyor belts, packing foam dispensers, the list goes on and on! So put on your thinking hard hats and start piecing together the puzzle. \n\nThis Factory Keeps Getting Weirder\n\nWhoever designed this factory really needs to get their head examined. From acid pools, space vacuums to rooftop gaps to clear, or just outright chaos on the floor. As you progress, the factory will throw tougher challenges at you with more and more complex conveyor belt builds to figure out. \n\n2 Player Couch Co-op Delight\n\nGrab a buddy and get this line moving double time! Work together, communicate, and juggle tasks frantically. NOTE: This game supports local couch co-op only; there is no online multiplayer mode. The game can be played in single-player, but it is recommended to play with one other person.\n\nEasy and Responsive Controls\n\nReady, Steady, Ship! is built around responsive yet simple controls, so almost anyone can quickly and easily join the fun.
