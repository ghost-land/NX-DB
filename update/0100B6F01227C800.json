    "description": "A PLANET'S LAST HOPE\nGlitch is chilling at his favorite local haunt when he sees something impossible in the sky: his home planet’s moons seem to be hemorrhaging life-giving Moon Juice—and what are those giant breweries sucking it all up? If Glitch doesn’t find out what’s going on and put a stop to it soon, all of the Moon Juice will be siphoned away and his own world won’t survive . Take control of the lovable hero in an action-packed, twitch-paced platformer that’s equal parts relentless and charming.\n\nEXPLORE THE MOONS\nTravel around planet Verdo’s four unique moons, each boasting extravagant environments and trippy themes. With 100 handcrafted levels, there’s a lot to experience.\n\nWATCH OUT\nExplosive platforms, snipers, gravity wells, charging brutes, lava, lasers, spikes, and so much more. With over 40 unique hazards and 16 killer enemies, you’ll never run out of danger.\n\nGLITCH OUT\nGlitch has a unique ability to get out of crazy near-death situations through becoming intangible. Use the ability to affect the environment in wild ways through toggling hidden blocks, flipping gravity, or making areas weightless.\n\nEPIC BOSSES\n4 epic bosses stand in your way to save Verdo. Liberate each moon from the tyrant occupying it and unlock the story of how they were corrupted by Moon Juice many years ago.\n\nNO NEED TO WAIT\nThe four moons are dangerous environments but nothing will deter Glitch from saving his planet. Instant respawns and fast load times make it easier to get you back into the game and improve your progress.\n\nTHE RIGHT CHALLENGE\nWe designed the game to be challenging but with 3 standards of difficulty, you can progress Glitch through our challenges at your own pace. Mastered Glitch's ability? Raise the stakes, play on our highest difficulty and top the leaderboards!",
