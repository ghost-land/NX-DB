    "description": "In a land plagued by powerful and twisted Mages, the condemned Marked Inquisitors take up the hunt.\n\nA once-peaceful kingdom is plunged into chaos by encroaching tides of Mages: merciless embodiments of elemental chaos. The Marked Inquisitors, a doomed force of the condemned, once again mobilizes to stand against the existential threat of Magic. A buried secret threatens to bring an ancient empire to utter ruin.\n\nAs a Marked Inquisitor, you’ll journey through the western frontier: pursuing, hunting, and obliterating the Mages that roam the realm. Craft unique weapons and armor from the otherworldly flesh and bones of the Mages you destroy. Master dozens of unique weapons and runic arts: “safe” manipulations of the corrupt Magic your foes wield. Explore a large and labyrinthine world filled with scavengers, secrets, traps, and powerful guardians. Team up with a fellow Inquisitor for full online co-op and drop-in quickplay online co-op, or engage in fast and chaotic PvP through various factions.\n\nYou may be bound to the Inquisition, but your choices are yours.",
