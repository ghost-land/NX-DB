    "description": "Cooking Mama: Cookstar is ALL NEW for the Nintendo Switch™ with over 80 fun and amazing recipes. \nFor the first time ever, Cooking Mama: Cookstar has both standard and vegetarian recipes! \nFrom classics recipes to Unicorn Food you can create your own amazing recipes with the help of Mama. \nThe new game will use the motion controls from the Nintendo Switch™ controllers to mimic all of your favorite cooking utensils. Players will be able to use their controllers to chop, slice, dice, mince, mash, knead and many more fun actions. \nEach minigame represents a different activity in the meal preparation, such as mixing, frying, or chopping the provided ingredients. The minigame mechanics themselves range from quickly drawing parallel lines in order to chop items, to a rhythm game where ingredients are added to a skillet or the heat is adjusted at precisely the right time. If the player makes a serious blunder or time expires without sufficient progress being made, that step in the cooking process is considered a failure. When this happens, a graphic of an angry \"Mama\" with flames erupting from her eyes is displayed, along with the caption \"Don't worry, Mama will fix it!\".\n",
