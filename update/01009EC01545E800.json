    "description": "In \"Tails of Trainspot\" you can escape the hustle and bustle of reality and immerse yourself in the world of the Packan Islands, communicate with the animal residents on the island, and delve into the mysterious history of the Packan Islands. In addition to the regular story mode, the game also offers an endless mode and a ranking challenge mode, allowing you to challenge your puzzle-solving skills to the fullest.\n\nThis is a logic puzzle game with simple and easy-to-understand rules, yet it is very challenging. The map has stations marked with numbers ranging from 1 to 8, indicating the actual number of rails required to reach the station. To solve the puzzle, players need to consider how to lay the tracks between stations, adjust the number of required tracks, and ensure that all stations are connected.\n\nHave a nice day in Packan Islands!",
