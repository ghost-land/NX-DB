    "description": "DEEEER Simulator is a game in which you take on the role of your average, everyday deer. Use your stretchy neck, your stabby horns, and everything a deer has in its arsenal to tear through the city. Frolic and play with the other animals or decimate the city till there's nothing left in this \"slow-life town destruction game\".\nGet up to enough naughtiness and you'll have to face off against some extra-tough animal police. Kung fu master sheep, bears who transform into police cars, and rabbits with ridiculously over-developed ears... They're all out to get you!\nLive life as a deer in the city and unleash your true potential!\nAnd don't forget to uncover the dark secret behind the city...",
