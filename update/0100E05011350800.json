Many of the 170 unique birds have powers that echo real life: your hawks will hunt, your pelicans will fish, and your geese will form a flock.\n\nFeatures\n* Relaxing strategy card game where your goal is to discover and attract the best birds.\n* Single player and multiplayer modes for up to five players.\n* Based on the award winning, competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game.\n* Hundreds of unique, animated birds with their real life sound recordings.\n* Multiple ways to accumulate points with birds, bonus cards and end-of-round goals.",
