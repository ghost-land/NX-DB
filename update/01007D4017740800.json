    "description": "Life has ceased. Man is but a myth. And now, even the machines have begun to fail. Explore a wasteland of rust and ruin, full of malfunctioning robots, mysterious devices, and ancient secrets. At its heart lies Metropol, the world’s last city, where an implacable, power-hungry foe awaits. \n\nThe android Horatio Nullbuilt spends his days studying the Book of Man, sparring with his sarcastic sidekick Crispin, and tinkering with the airship they call home — but their peaceful existence is destroyed when a rogue robot steals the power source they need to survive. Their search for energy will reveal buried truths about Metropol, mankind, and Horatio himself. \n\nWhat happened to the humans? And what fate awaits their mechanical inheritors? The answer will depend on the path you take and the choices you make. \n\nThe game draws inspiration from traditional point-and-click adventures, adding an integrated hint system, multi-solution puzzles, and automatic note-taking and mapping, making it a favorite of players of all experience levels. For completionists, alternate endings, a developer commentary mode, and hidden secrets await on a second playthrough.",
