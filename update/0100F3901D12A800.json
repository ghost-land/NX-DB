    "description": "\"OLLLO\" is a new type of puzzle action game in which players advance through a series of screen loops.\nThe key to the strategy is a special ability called \"OLLLO\".\nWith this ability, the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the screen are connected, allowing the player to move freely to and from the edges of the screen.\nThe ability can be used in a wide variety of ways, such as looping left and right to get behind walls, or looping up and down to climb unclimbable scaffolds.\nCombined with a variety of gimmicks, such as gravity reversal and instantaneous movement, the possibilities are even greater.\n\nMore than 70 stages, ranging from simple to complex, are included. Whether you can complete them depends on your logic and inspiration.\n",
