    "description": "Across four chapters, you'll need to goÂ back in time and subtly rewrite history, trigger the butterfly effect, solve the puzzles hidden in it, and even change the future of Babel!\n\nA World of Wonder\nFrom the drenched deck to the bustling Central Station, the busy Memory Factory to the empty Giant Boiler...... Explore the Babel, meet panic-stricken humans and tough crew members, and investigate unprecedented instruments and strange creatures!\n\nParallel Storytelling\nThe pilot stuck in the monsoon, the head chef worrying about the canned food, the swimming team captain chasing fugitives...... Oh, and the poor circus clown looking for his daughter! The fates of the characters complement each other, and this is destined to be a tragicomedy about separation.\n\nQuests and Puzzles\nYou need to help the trapped characters overcome difficulties: escape from the Interrogation Room, collect Stonehearth Crab Egg, and find mysterious signal sources... Don't expect to succeed with brute force!\nFortunately, you can travel back in time and discover what put them into trouble. Once you've located the crucial event, you can rewrite it with the pen in your hand. This move will immediately trigger a butterfly effect, change the plot's path, and reverse the current situation!",
