    "description": "In Before Exit: Supermarket, as a supermarket employee, your job is to close the store at night. With everyone gone, your supervisor has given you the responsibility to lock up. Can you handle it? \n\nThe game combines roguelike features with logical riddles and a walking simulator genre to create a unique experience. Play day by day to find all the assignments, and remember every task before coming back home.\n\nMake sure you turn off all the lights, close all the refrigerators, and clean the questionably clean floor. But wait - is that expired yogurt? Is one letter in a neon sign not lit? Did someone leave a piece of paper behind the store counter?\n\nYour boss is extremely strict, so if even one condition is not met, you will face the harsh reality of being fired. The pressure is on. Can you handle it? The fate of your virtual job is in your hands.",
