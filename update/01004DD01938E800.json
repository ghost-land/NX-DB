    "description": "It’s so cute, chibi, and light-hearted looking, you may be asking yourself if this is even a real Valis game - but it absolutely is, and its name is Syd of Valis! \n\nWield the magical Sword of Valis as Yuko (Syd in the localized version), and bust your way through the game’s 5 stages.\n\nAn original stage with an absolutely bonkers powerful boss awaits you at the end of your adventure. \n\nIt’s a totally unique Valis experience that will continue to hit you with surprise after surprise from not just the visuals, but the gameplay too!",
