    "description": "As a newly appointed captain of the Pegasus corporation, you must guide a roster of colorful pilots, eclectic advisors and state-of-the-art landers through a taxing series of missions. Deliver cargo, retrieve resources, and rescue stranded pilots as you navigate a mysterious universe of moons and planets.\n\nIt’s a thankless job, replete with tension and danger, and it takes a psychological toll on your crew. But someone has to keep this unseen lifeblood of the interplanetary economy moving.\n\nWhen a mysterious portal appears, leading to a strange, unexplored planet, you will find you are on a collision course with some sinister truths that lie unseen behind the universe. Poor flying and fatigue will stress your pilots, and can lead to sensory illusions … the bane of long-haul solo pilots. They may start to see things that may not be real – is that a mine or a fish? And what’s with those celestial pink elephants?!\n\nWith multiple pilots, four ships and a dozen upgrades to collect, you can get the job done if you can manage it all … if not, the stakes are high, and not just for your career.\n\nFeatures\n\nBeautiful Art: a luxurious sci-fi landscape in Dreams Uncorporated’s unique, hand-drawn style\n\nDeep Campaign: Tackle 30 missions across five moons and planets: Nueva Luna, Mars, Venus, Ganymede, and the mysterious Etimus\n\nDifficulty Settings: Four difficulty levels, with the highest one, insane, raising the stakes with permadeath\n\nCustomization: Countless pilot options, with procedurally generated characters and attributes, four unique ships, and a dozen upgrades to equip\n\nDon’t Go Mad: Keep your wits about you – rising stress will lead to hallucinations and space madness!",
