    "description": "Severed Steel is a single-player FPS featuring a fluid stunt system, destructible voxel environments, loads of bullet time, and a unique one-armed protagonist. It's you, your trigger finger, and a steel-toed boot against a superstructure full of bad guys. Chain together wall runs, dives, flips, and slides to take every last enemy down.\n\nKey Features:\nA unique fighter - Play as Steel, a nimble, one-armed sharpshooter on a mission. There is no reloading – pick your shots well and be ready to pry a loaded weapon from your enemies' cold dead hands.\n\nStylish combat - Dodge bullets, leap off walls, slide kick, throw weapons – do whatever it takes to come out on top in intense and frenzied firefights.\n\nFully destructible environment - Pepper through plaster with sharp 4.7 mm rounds, punch through thick concrete with .50 cal slugs, or make big holes in things with your arm cannon.\n\nDynamic AI - No two battles are the same thanks to dynamic, unscripted, squad-based AI.\n\nFirefight Mode - Chase high scores and fast times for leaderboard acclaim in this arcade-styled mode. Features 42 levels, each with their own sub-challenges, and over 20 unlockable, game modifying 'Mutators'.\n\nCampaign Mode - Blast through six compact story chapters as you battle against the forces of nefarious mega-corporation, EdenSys.\n\nAccessibility - A range of adjustable settings for features such as difficulty, visuals, audio, controls, navigation, and more.",
