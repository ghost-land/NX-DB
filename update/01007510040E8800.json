    "description": "The European Truck Racing Championship is one of the most spectacular and challenging motor racing competitions. \n\nThe driving difficulty and many unique race features have been faithfully reproduced with the KT Engine (WRC).\nIn ETRC, like on real-life race tracks, you need to control the temperature of your brakes so they don't overheat. You must also consider the weight of the truck when cornering, monitor tyre wear and find the best tactics for overtaking.\n\nThe official FIA ETRC game is a completely new option for all fans of racing sims.\n• 45 trucks with their official livery, including top manufacturers like Volvo, Man, Freightliner and Western Star\n• 20 teams and the championship's best drivers\n• 14 circuits including official ETRC ones,  as well as Laguna Seca, Circuit of The Americas and Fuji Speedway\n• 5 single-player modes and 5 multiplayer modes",
