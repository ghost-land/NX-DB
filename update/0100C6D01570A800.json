    "description": "The Legend of Yeah Yeah Beebiss I\n\nLong ago there was legend of a new video game that had no screenshots, no reviews, no advertisements -- nothing. Just a quick blurb in the back of some magazines saying it was for sale. It was never released. This is a sequel to that mythical game.\n\nAs Kyonshi Hui and Jiangshi Bo, it is your quest to banish all evil in all 100 levels - 10 original stages, including the boss -- a mutated mass of pure evil. Hui prefers zapping foes while Bo prefers absorbing their life force.\n\nGood luck!\n\n- 100 Levels\n- 10 Unique Stages\n- 2 Players\n- Original Chiptune Retro Soundtrack\n- Manual and Box Art Viewer\n- Two Playable Characters\n",
