    "description": "In Roller Drama, you (Joan) live with & coach five kickass athletes: Anne, Portia, Lily, Cordelia, and Juliet. Together they form a top Roller Derby team, a full contact sport on quad skates!\n\nYour job is to act as a keeper of the team, managing both their personal and professional lives. Try to balance everyone’s emotions as they navigate rivalries, friendships, and love.\n\nREAL-TIME FULL-CONTACT SPORT!\n\nWhile personal dramas rage on, you’ll also need to manage Roller Derby matches in real time! Plan strategies, give orders, and manage the match using arcade-inspired controls.\n\nSURVEILLANCE\n\nRoller Drama is set in a dystopian alternative world where things are going… slightly worse than they are here. Political and environmental upheavals interfere with daily life.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Interactive narrative with meaningful choices (100!) and multiple endings\n- Vivid, explorable universe\n- Replayable narrative and matches: every championship is unique, several different endings\n- Replay a specific chapter\n- Real-time roller derby matches\n- Coach a team of five athletes with wildly different personalities\n- Hand drawn character art by award winning illustrator Vic Macioci\n\nNote: this is not a Roller Derby simulator: match gameplay is inspired by Roller Derby but it then defines its own kind of game.",
