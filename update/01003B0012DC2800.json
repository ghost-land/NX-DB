    "description": "What begins as a normal day in Tokyo turns out to be everything but, when the Conception – an ethereal apocalypse – is invoked.  The remains of the world are swallowed by chaos, as a demonic revolution descends into a broken city.  Caught between a battle of Gods and demons, the choices you make can bring life, rebirth, or death, and determine who triumphs.  \n\nThis genre-defining, infamously punishing RPG is back and now includes: \nRemastered 3D models and backgrounds \nAdditional difficulty settings for players of all skill levels \nSuspend save -- save your progress whenever you need!  \nVoiced audio -- choose between Japanese and English VO ",
