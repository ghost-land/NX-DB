    "description": "It was after the descent of uncountable goddesses in Japan...\n\nMost goddesses were able to blend in with humans, living peacefully and happily together. Some of those goddesses even went on to become idols.\nHowever, there were others who simply refused to follow the rules. These goddesses prefer living freely and doing as they please, inadvertently causing all sorts of trouble for humans.\n\nGoddesses who are naughty are called Aragami.\n\nThe protagonist, Sho Narumi, stumbles upon a goddess who collapses on the street and attempts to help her. Soon enough it is revealed that she's the Aragami who had been causing frequent power outages in one small-town area of Tokyo. Sho decides to protect his beloved hometown by helping the goddess to get rehabilitated!\n\n\"Rehabilitate the goddess!\"\n\nWait...aren't goddesses supposed to help humans?\n\nWith the setting moving from Akihabara to a quiet small-town area of Tokyo, the story of one naughty goddess's rehabilitation begins now!",
