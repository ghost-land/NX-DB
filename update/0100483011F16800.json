    "description": "Dive into the Tri6 cyberspace, avoid procedurally distributed obstacles and beat the evil Virus enemies as long as possible to reach the top of the global leaderboards! Play locally in up to 4-player multiplayer and make life difficult for your friends using different powerups from missiles and mines to boosts and jumps.\n\nFeatures:\n- 3 playable vehicles with different steering characteristics\n- 11 unlockable powerups\n- More than 300 obstacle variations\n- Global leaderboards per vehicle across all supported platforms\n- Up to 4 players splitscreen support\n\nObstacles:\nMore than 300 obstacle variations that are randomly distributed and get harder with every lap will lead to endless variations of the track. And be careful, not every obstacle is just static! There are also Virus vehicles driving along the track with you, trying to put an end to your existence.\n\nPowerups:\nWhile playing you will collect electrons that unlock new powerups. The powerups will allow you to survive longer and defeat the Virus constructs. They are grouped in active ones that are reusable (e.g. missiles) and passive ones that are consumable (e.g. shield).\n\nSplitscreen:\nPlay together with up to three friends on one device. Drive the track, avoid obstacles and survive longer than your friends. Of course you can use all your powerups against them to decrease their three lives down to zero.",
