    "description": "A new type of soothing puzzle game where you guide cats to their dens (warp holes) by manipulating a Joy-Conâ„¢ cat wand. When you guide the cats with the designated patterns into the holes in the correct order, a combo occurs. Successful combos extend the time limit. Once the game starts, carefully observe the patterns of the cats and plan your route to the dens. Sometimes, you have to solve the mysteries placed on the stage for the dens to appear. Users who participated in the crowdfunding can see their own cats' photos and names featured as card items in the game. Lead the special cats that appear on the stage to the dens in large numbers to complete your card collection.",
