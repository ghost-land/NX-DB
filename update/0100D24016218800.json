    "description": "Abomi Nation is a roguelike monster-taming RPG. Every playthrough will create a new version of Abomi Nation and provide a unique world with different Abomis for you to find. Explore your universe, watch your Abomis bond, and battle it out as your adventure unfolds in a way totally unique to you!\n\nBATTLE FOR ABOMI NATION\nBuild your party from over 175 Abomis to recruit, evolve and master! No two teams will be alike! Inspired by the Nuzlocke challenge, Abomi Nation is designed to be extremely replayable and customizable.\n\nMaster a unique turn-based battle system that emphasizes 1-on-1 combat, but allows for tactics that impact benched Abomis before they even enter the fray. Unleash devastating attacks such as ‘Infernal Blast’ and ‘Quivering Quake’ to exploit your opponents' weaknesses, or rally your own teammates with moves like ‘Speech!’\n\nFIGHT...TO THE DEATH?\nEvery Abomi possesses tremendous abilities. Via their elemental types (Neutral, Fire, Water, Ice, Plant, Lightning, Air, and Earth), Abomis in a different time utilized power and strategy to dominate each other. After becoming civilized, most Abomis tended to forget about their violent history... But, now, as a powerful threat emerges, your team will have to rediscover their powers and fight for Abomi Nation's safety.\n\nIf an Abomi falls in a permadeath battle, it will be gone forever! It's up to you to overcome the challenge ahead, adapt, and protect as many team members as you can. Don't worry, though! If you end up losing all of your Abomis, you can continue your run with permadeath turned off at the sacrifice of some rewards. So give it your best shot!\n\nA NEW ISLAND EVERY RUN\nEvery run of Abomi Nation will generate a uniquely-shaped island for your team to traverse, offering up a different combination of areas, bosses, and Abomis to recruit every time you play! Replayability is a main focus of Abomi Nation. You can fight any combination of Abomis at any time!\n\nNo two teams will be alike in Abomi Nation thanks to the myriad of randomized factors that go into each run. Abomis have different personalities from one another, and this will impact how multiple Abomis react to the same situation. As your adventure unfolds, the bond between any two Abomis will grow, causing them to behave differently when their friends are in danger.\n\nYou'll also be able to unlock new Abomi forms, new areas, and new items the more runs you play. This island is truly always changing!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR GAME\nThere will always be ways to tweak your game's settings to keep each new run feeling fresh. Play at your own pace! Want to completely randomize which Abomis can spawn at any level? Want more control over who you add to your team? Want to control whether your team members will permanently die in battle or not? You'll have the freedom to play the game in a length and manner that suits you.\n\nRECRUIT GUEST CREATURES\nNot everything in Abomi Nation is about fighting, either. Experience cuteness overload while you boost your team’s stats by eating together, playing minigames, and participating in all sorts of events offered by friendly townsfolk. It's OK to enjoy some down time in between life-risking battles.\n\nWithin the random pool of 175+ Abomis lie some guest characters from indie hits Bug Fables: The Everlasting Sapling and Disc Creatures!\n\nPit your favorite Abomis against the many enemies and bosses from Bug Fables, or maybe pat a Tomatee from Disc Creatures on its little head! Abomi Nation allows for all of these different worlds to blend together.",
