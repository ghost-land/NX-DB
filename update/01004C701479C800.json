    "description": "Join a stuffed bear named Teddy on this gloomy and sinister adventure to rescue his owner, Alicia, from the realm of dreams and distorted childhood fantasies. Who else will fight for the life of the girl, now grown-up, if not her long-forgotten and dusty toy?\n\nThe Darkest Tales is a complex and compelling adventure, full of familiar characters and fairytale landscapes. Over the course of the journey, you’ll have to come face-to-face with the difficult questions of life more than once.\n\n\nHappily Never After\nYou’ll meet familiar characters from your childhood, but the reunion isn’t likely to be a happy one. The gingerbread men are out for blood, Sleeping Beauty seems to be a couple centuries behind on sleep, and the Little Mermaid looks more like a sea witch than an innocent child of the waves.\n\n\nTeddy Scissorpaws\nAs it turns out, our hero is a jack-of-all-trades. He crafted a bow and melee weapons from a pair of scissors and uses needles as powerful arrows and grappling hooks. All’s fair in a fight against the forces of evil.\n\n\nAhead lies only darkness\nEach level takes place in a recognizable, but distorted fairytale world rife with combat, obstacles, and secrets. On this journey you will gain experience, master and branch out your skills, and overcome a multitude of challenges — from fighting blood-thirsty rubber duckies to exploring the giants’ castle in the clouds.\n\n\nThe Darkest Tales is a game with deep and mysterious lore. As you progress and defeat monsters, you’ll unveil the mysteries of this nightmarish world. How will this tale end? It’s up to you to decide.",
