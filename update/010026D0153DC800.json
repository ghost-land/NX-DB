    "description": "On the distant shores of a certain river, a cute but macabre procession is climbing the stairs. \nWeary travelers of this underworld domain, exhausted by their long journey, are going to take the next step on their journey...\nBut before that, why not take the bite out of that tasty steaming hot apple pie, just like your nana used to make!\n\nYou are a ferocious beast, a guardian of the underworld, the untamed and wild cooking cat!\nAs the master chef of the underworld, let the traveling souls a taste of mortal food, to rejuvenate them on their long journey.\n\nGATHERING\nPlants do grow in the underworld. But they are fragile in nature, requiring constant care for them to grow in this foreign environment.\n\nFISHING\nSome stray fish also snucks into the underworld from time to time. \nWhich is extremely good news for you, because which real \"Cat Chef\" does not enjoy a bit of fishing (and subsequently sashimi) on the side?\n\nCOOKING \nThe solemn and silent spookies of the underworld wish only to feast on mortal food - the best relief from their grueling travel.\nArm yourself with the cooking utensils and prepare the best dishes you can think of. Your ghastly customers are a bit reluctant to part with their coin, though. \nMake sure, to \"woo\" them properly into buying stuff. And be careful, as some of them are daring enough to steal the products of your hard labor!\n\nLEARNING\nGood recipes don't grow on trees. By expanding your catalog of ingredients, you will inevitably learn more recipes to cook.",
