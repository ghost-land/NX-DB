    "description": "Explore an enthralling forest island, learn magical songs and interact with the local wildlife to solve environmental puzzles.\n\nToki Tori 2+’s ingenious game design requires just two moves: whistle and stomp. It's super accessible, yet it builds up to incredible complexity later on.\n\nThere’s a ton to do, too. After puzzle-solving your way to five Ancient Frogs and saving the island from a strange pollution, you can still find 100s of golden wings, snap dozens of creature pictures and go Achievement hunting.\n\nToki Tori 2+ is better than ever on Nintendo Switch™, with lots of gameplay tweaks and even some new secrets and puzzle solutions. Plus, you can now create checkpoints wherever you like, allowing for easy experimentation.\n\n- A unique take on the Metroidvania formula\n- Follow the path, or stray off-road and tackle the expert puzzles\n- Whistle magical songs to rewind, fast-travel and more\n- Snap dozens of Tokidex creature pictures\n\nBetter than ever on Nintendo Switch:\n- Tweaked gameplay, new secrets and solutions\n- Buttery smooth graphics at 60 fps\n- Featuring in-game Achievements\n- HD Rumble support\n- Video capture support",
