I will guide you as best I can, but the rest is up to you.\"\n\nWhat is it?\nYou start the game at hero camp where you must create your party and then go on journey throughout the world by choosing different areas. Choose each area based on your party’s strengths and weakness, draw adventure cards, roll dice, fight monsters and reach the chaos castle to defeat the sorcerer and his magic.\n\nFeatures\n• 12 heroes and over 60 monsters\n• Procedurally generated adventures and combat\n• Rogue-lite experience where you create a party of heroes and play until you win or die\n• 13 areas to play with over 150 adventure cards\n• Survive the skull of fate and the sorcerer's magic\n• Tactical based turn based combat with controlled random numbers\n• 80+ combat cards ranging from spells, weapons, potions and equipment\n• Unique art world that looks, feels and plays like a tabletop\n• Voice over for the sorcerer playing the role of the Dungeon Master\n\nThe ultimate tabletop game, unlike anything you have ever seen before!\n\nDark Quest\nIt's a game of your imagination",
