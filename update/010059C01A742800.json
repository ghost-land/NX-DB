    "description": "Cthulhu heard the call\nIn search of eternal life, you invited forces beyond your understanding. You must invade that abominable eldritch mountain of slushy nastiness known as Cthulhu. Be it your atonement or damnation. \n\nYou are in Control\nDodge, roll, dash, wall jump, backflip, frontflip, hang from ropes, and keep on shooting while doing it. Madshot offers a really fluid and responsive movement where youâ€™re always in control to create intense and cool moments. \n\n\nSlaughter your way to Cthulhu\nThere's a multitude of areas that each offer unique enemies and mechanics. \nKill enough enemies to charge a blood portal that summons rewards and a path to the next area and then survive epic and dreadful multi-phased boss battles.\n\n\nCreate lethal combinations\nThere's a big focus on synergies between Weapons, sidearms, upgrades, and ultimate abilities that you can combine to make each run unique and fun. \n",
