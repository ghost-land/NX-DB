Master the momentum based rolling and gliding controls, and spread the chill vibes in more than 20 colourful levels over 5 sun-drenched environments;\n- Lazy summer beaches of Temaki Sands\n- Overgrown city scape of Maple City\n- Chill bubbling rapids of Konichiwa Falls\n- Glistening ice caps of Narwhal Station\n- Sugar rush inducing Pudding Valhalla\n\nAll across 2 relaxing gameplay modes, ‘Target Test’ and ‘Sweet Rush’. Soar through the open skies collecting sweets, nabbing powerups and uncovering hidden routes and top it off with a perfect landing. For these bonnie fish the goal is not winning but enjoying the great weather, chill vibes and relaxing days while they last.\n",
