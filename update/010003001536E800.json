    "description": "- Who did you spend time with at that time?\n- It is not just an encounter of love.\n\nIn 1988, Japan was under a bubble economy. New buildings have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, and the social atmosphere is very lively in the era. The ancient objects gradually disappear, and new creatures are constantly born. Christmas Tina tells a story about boys and girls living hard under the shadow of the modern city. Their bond can break through the language barrier. Without words spoken, they already understand each other.\n",
