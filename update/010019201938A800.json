    "description": "An ever-changing endless visual experience\nEl Shaddai's artistic setting aims to provide a canvas-like world that changes in an organic way as long as you progress your adventure. The world keeps changing constantly in the most creative and innovative ways, perhaps even nostalgic.\n\nEasy to play, hard to master \nYou'll only have four buttons: jump, attack, guard and weapon stealing. But this simple way of proceeding is deeper than one can expect. There is no need of manuals or walkthroughs to get into the game, but if anyone is ready to deepen into the mechanics, the game will offer a profound, precise and rewarding timing-based action experience. The motto of El Shaddai's gameplay always was to be \"easy but profound\". Many of the game's mechanics such as the offense-defense systems were carefully created to provide the best possible game feel.\n\n◆Additional elements\nThis time we have implemented full HD support, optimized loading and optimazation in general.\nAlso, as a bonus content, the post-ending novel \"Lucifer's Fall Chronicles of Ceta\" and El Shaddai ASCENSION OF THE METATRON ArtBook are included.",
