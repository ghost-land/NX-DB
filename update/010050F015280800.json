This game does not support online matchmaking but can still be enjoyed remotely using livestreaming services or video conferencing tools. \n\n\nAbout Each Game\n\n\nDrawful Animate (3 -10 players) - It’s alive! The guessing game with terrible drawings and hilariously wrong answers makes a dynamic return. In this revamped title, players create looping, two-frame animations based on weird and random titles.\n\nThe Wheel of Enormous Proportions (2-8 players) - Trivia has never been so large! A fantastic, mystical wheel challenges you with a variety of trivia prompts. Winners are awarded slices of the Wheel’s face with a chance to win big with each nail-biting spin. In the end, one player will have their most burning question answered by the great Wheel.\n\nJob Job (3-10 players) - Use other people’s words to create unique and funny answers to classic job interview questions. Go head to head to see who scores the job!\n\nThe Poll Mine (2-10 players) - A survey game that’s all about YOU! Split into teams and see who can escape from the witch’s lair! Players individually rank their choices to a difficult question, then must guess how the group answered as a whole. How well do you know your friends?!\n\nWeapons Drawn (4-8 players) - A social deduction game where everyone is both a murderer and a detective. Players doodle all the clues, hiding a letter from their name in the weapon drawings. Can you solve murders while trying to get away with your own?",
