    "description": "The \"Sacabambaspis\" is not a very good swimmer. It will swim automatically, but as it does so, continuously rise to the sea surface.\nPress the button to make it dive to the bottom of the ocean.\nTry to go as far as you can without hitting any obstacles.\n\nIf you rise too high, dive too low, or hit an obstacle, it's game over.\n(It's fine if you hit the air bubbles!)\n\nAs you continue to swim, it becomes increasingly difficult.\n\nIt might become night time, or you might go to the past or the future!?\n\nBeat your high score and brag to your friends!",
