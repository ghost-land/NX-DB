    "description": "Ninjin: Clash of Carrots is an anime-inspired beat-‘em-up with a gaggle of varied enemies, deep customization…and ninjas! Play through side-scrolling worlds consisting of multiple stages and collect carrots stolen by the evil Shogun Moe! Carrots act as currency which can be redeemed in the Corgi Store for new equipment, or the Shady Shop for special weapons, masks and other customization items. Grab a friend to join you in 2-player online or local co-op. \n\nFeaturing over 150 weapons, projectiles, upgrades, and more to modify the experience to each player’s preference, Ninjin: Clash of Carrots is an action-packed thrill-fest with a unique and immersive storyline, stylish environments, and exciting and frenetic gameplay!
