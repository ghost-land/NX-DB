    "description": "Cycle 28 is a space shooter in the classic arcade style that keeps you pushing for a high score. The controls are simple. The action is fast-paced. Intense dogfights lead to epic, screen-filling bosses.\n\nFast-paced combat — Power slide your way between more bullets than any lesser pilot could handle. Nothing feels better than using your ship’s gun to propel you through enemy-infested space as you grip the trigger ever tighter.\n\nUpgrades — Beat your personal high score in a run to unlock upgrades. With 45 possible configurations, customise your ship and master new tactics to live just a little longer.\n\nEvolving story — Uncover the secrets of why you’re stuck in Cycle, why the enemy is hell-bent on destroying everything you love, and just who they really are.\n\nEpic original score — A powerfully atmospheric mix of modern orchestral and retro electronic sounds by Jordan Rees. (Composer of trailer music for The Mummy [Universal Pictures], Mother [Paramount Pictures], The Defenders [Marvel Studios].)\n",
