    "description": "Azure Striker Gunvolt Striker Pack brings the electrifying 2D side-scrolling action games \"Azure Striker Gunvolt\" and \"Azure Striker Gunvolt 2\", which previously made their home on the Nintendo 3DS™, onto the Nintendo Switch™ in one single package.\n\nIn \"Azure Striker Gunvolt\", you take control of Gunvolt's high-speed mobility and repertoire of electrical attacks to make short work of your enemies. As an \"adept\" who possesses supernatural \"septimal powers,\" Gunvolt fights for the freedom of the nation from the tyrannical rule of the massive conglomerate known as the Sumeragi Group and the invasion of a super-powerful group of adepts known as Eden.\n\nAzure Striker Gunvolt's deep storyline plays out both during breaks in the action and in the thick of battle too! Featuring a robust cast of characters that are fully voiced (in Japanese) and over 25 vocal tracks performed by characters in the game, the world of Gunvolt provides excitement at every turn.\n\nThe Nintendo Switch™ version also features a slew of upgrades from the Nintendo 3DS™ version, including a 60 FPS upgrade, upgraded UI, high-resolution event graphics, the entire DLC catalog from the Nintendo 3DS™ version pre-loaded into the game, a brand new vocal track from the character Lumen, AKA \"The Muse\", HD Rumble compatibility, and more!",
