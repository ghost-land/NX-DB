    "description": "IMAGE FIGHT is a scrolling shoot 'em up game released by Irem in 1988.\nClear the VR training course, then take the fight up into outer space!\nAfter you clear each stage, you can check and see how many ships you destroyed. If you still don't have a good score after clearing stage 5, you may have to take a supplementary course...\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
