    "description": "From Black Eyed Priest and Henry Hoare, the sick minds behind Bloodwash, comes this latest experiment in brain ripping terror. Night of the Gates of Hell promises to be a blood dripping, neon soaked, flesh rotting experience.\n\nA survival horror adventure game ripped straight from the Italian zombie horror films it was inspired by. Throughout chapters, players navigate levels in search of clues, weapons and items to solve puzzles and help them escape or destroy the zombies between them and safety. Enemies range from crazed cultists to flesh hungry zombies and must all be taken down with extreme precision, because only headshots kill these maggot-filled monsters. Can you survive the zombie apocalypse, or will you end up being just another walking corpse?",
