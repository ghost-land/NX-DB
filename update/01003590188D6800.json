    "description": "Based on the classic Lander games that were made popular during the 1980's, in Galactic Pioneer you must navigate an exploration module across ten varied and increasingly difficult planets with limited fuel and even more limited lives, with the goal being to make a great landing, get the highest score possible and place on the leader board.\n\nYou will have to contend with various obstacles, such as cannon fire from hostile aliens, falling fiery debris from an active volcano and a lightning storm as you make your way toward the landing pad of your choice, many of which being placed deep underground accessible only by traversing through tight corridors and passageways, you must do this all while battling the gravitational pull that increases with each planet you visit.\n\nCompete with your friends and family for leaderboard supremacy or for an added challenge, separate the Joy-Con and work as a team with each of you controlling either the horizontal or vertical thrust of your exploration module.\n\nIt's time to ask yourself:\nDo you have what it takes to get on the leaderboard?\nAre you the best pilot in your family or friend group?\nAre you good enough to make ten great landings and reach #1?\nCAN YOU FLY THIS EXPLORATION MODULE...AND LAND IT?\n\nFeatures:\nRetro arcade action.\nVaried level design.\nLocal Leaderboard.\nChallenging levels.\nFull colour pixel art graphics.",
