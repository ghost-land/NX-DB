    "description": "\"an experience everyone should play through at least once\" - Nintendo World Report\n\nMeet fascinating characters on your quest to complete the imperfect Circle. New partners bring unique abilities and their own personality to roll with...\nIn this 3-5 hours adventure, full of ups and downs but always playful and rewarding, the Circle learns about itself and you, along with it.\n\n• \"The perfect mix of platform-puzzling goodness, and deep, profound story-telling.\" Cubed3\n\n• “It is a minimalist romantic tale that plumbs the depth of human emotion, examining angst and anxiety and impermanence. For a game populated by talking trees, circles and balloons, it depicts a universally human story in a genuinely lovely way.” Pure Nintendo\n\n• “Visually, the game is simple yet striking. The clever use of the minimal color palette makes for stunning environments that are both varied and memorable.” COGconnected\n\n• “Journey of the Broken Circle is a unique and special type of game.” Nintendo World Report\n\nDEVELOPED BY Lovable Hat Cult\n“It’s a game about this little something that always seems to be missing…a better job, a nicer place to live, an ideal relationship… We wanted to tell a story of self-discovery in a fun, universal and relatable way. We probably also wanted to answer our own questions: would the Circle find what it was looking for? Or how would it all end?” - Andrea & Patrick from the Copenhagen-based studio.\n\nPUBLISHED BY Nakana.io\n“We gather games that share a strong experience to remember. We hope you’ll enjoy the sweet and tasteful food for thought served by Journey of the Broken Circle!” - Mikaël Bourget, founder of the publishing label.",
