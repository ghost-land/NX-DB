During a routine defense operation, Daaia receives a mysterious message from humanity's mortal enemy, the Rolars. The message kick-starts an intergalactic adventure of epic proportions inspired by 80s and 90s anime. Visit alien planets, meet all kinds of weird and silly characters, and uncover the truth behind the war with the Rolars.\n\nShikon-X draws inspiration from the golden era of point and click games, though flips the genre on its head by offering an approachable and streamlined experience. No feverish mouse clicks, no verbs, and no awkward wheels of actions. There is one inventory button and one interaction button. Simply interact with a character or an object, and things will happen! In space, no one can hear you call the hint line...\n\nShikon X features a variety of playable arcade mini-games throughout the adventure. Fend off invaders from space in a retro-inspired arcade shooter, or flaunt your flipper skills in a fully-featured pinball table. Every mini-game serves a purpose, and even some story beats will develop during these scenes!\n\nKey Features\n\nStreamlined ‘point and click’ experience without any pointing and clicking\nGameplay designed with approachability in mind\nIntergalactic adventure inspired by 80s and 90s anime\nArcade mini-games that help drive the narrative forward",
