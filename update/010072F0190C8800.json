    "description": "You are Roman, an orphan and former soldier, seeking gainful employment. After coming across a mysterious job advertisement in your local newspaper, you hop on the next train to the Kingdom of Gardenia, to meet King Theseus IV and see what's what. As grounds keeper, and interim steward of the West Garden, you will cater for the needs of visitors by getting to know them, serving their favourite food, impressing them with the wealth of the kingdom and delighting them with their favourite flowers, trees, or furnishings. Beware though, there is an evil presence lurking in the shadows, trying to undo your good work!",
