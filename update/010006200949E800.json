Popular voice actors known for their talent in anime and video games bring our five main characters to life. Your ears will thank you to hear their performances across all the main scenarios.\n\n-Story\nOur heroine, Amane Kosaka, was living a simple yet happy life in the countryside until one day she was suddenly taken away to live in the empire, summoned by her brother Soshi Amazaki -- the current ruler. Though she was unaware of the underlying circumstances, she finds herself brought to this lively and palpable central city.\n\nLiving in the immaculate royal palace, our heroine comes to learn that the empire might not be as joyful as it seems. \nHer brother is no longer the gentle man she once knew...\nA corrupt organization secretly runs things behind the scenes...\nThe heroine’s fate guides her down the path of love.\n\n-Voice Actor\nToki Tanba CV: Tetsuya Kakihara (柿原徹也)\nKei Yoshimine CV: Toshiki Masuda (増田俊樹)\nKoichiro Sera CV: Takuya Eguchi (江口拓也)\nKagemitsu Togawa CV: Toshiyuki Toyonaga (豊永利行)\nSoshi Amazaki CV: Kenjiro Tsuda (津田健次郎)\n\n-illustrations\nMitsuya Fuji (藤未都也)",
