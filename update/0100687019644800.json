    "description": "Welcome to 2099, where all communication must use correct grammar. Anyone who uses incorrect grammar will accumulate bad credits that lead to getting fired, denied public service, or even jailed.\n\nPlay as a fresh graduate of theoretical mathematics who, because of some mix-up, now has to work as a grammar validator in the biggest grammar validation agency.\n\nUse your grammar and management skills to work your way up from “Junior Passable Intern” to “Editor Extraordinaire.” Find and correct grammatical mistakes in documents, learn some new grammar rules, and beat your colleagues in a grammar battle. If you are doing well, you can upgrade your crummy apartment, adopt a pet, or ride a helicopter to the office. Everything is possible in Grammarian Ltd.",
