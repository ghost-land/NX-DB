    "description": "Teacup is a short and wholesome narrative adventure game with a focus on exploration and non-linear progression.\n\nYou play as the titular Teacup, a shy and introverted young frog who loves drinking tea and reading. The day before she is to host a tea party at her house, she realizes she is completely out of tea, and thus must venture into the woods around her to find the herbs she needs to restock her pantry.\n\nDuring your adventure you will meet the charming inhabitants of the forest. Some are talkative, some are grumpy, but all of them will lend you an ear on your adventure.\n\nExplore this gorgeous watercolor world filled with friendly animals, playful minigames, puzzles, and beautiful, calming wilderness.
