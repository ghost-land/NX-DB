You will need every tool available to survive.\n\nKey Features:\n    -Deep, cryptic, and mysterious lore left behind by the last remnants of humanity\n    -A diverse array of weapons and items, each with their own utility\n    -A vast, open-ended sprawling metropolis, and dying world to explore\n    -Over a dozen terrifying, twisted and unique enemy types\n    -Brutal non-linear action RPG with Dark Souls inspired gameplay, emphasizing a balance of lethality and stamina\n    -7-12 hours of gameplay",
