    "description": "It’s a Wrap! is a challenging 2D puzzle platformer set in 1980s Hollywood, where you play both the director and the star of action-packed, low-budget films.\n\nAll you wanted to do today was shoot a nice little popcorn movie, but everything is going wrong! As the director, you need to synchronize the actors and props that are messing up their timings. Then, as the movie’s star, you need to remember your script and play out the scene—without getting crushed by that giant boulder!\n\nFeatures\n\nDirector’s Phase. Grab your megaphone and hop into the director’s chair to puzzle your way through the timing of props, actors, and special effects to make your scene work—and keep your star in one piece.\n\nAction Phase. When you think you’ve got your scene set up correctly, roll the cameras and enjoy a variety of traditional 2D gameplay like platforming, car chases, and space battles where you control the movie star Johnny Rush in his most iconic roles.\n\nA hundred colorful ways to “die”. Every time you fail, poor Johnny—who does not have a stunt double—will suffer a hilarious demise inspired by classic cartoons and adventure games. But don’t worry about long-lasting injuries, just rewind back to the beginning of the scene and try again!\n\nHeaping spoonfuls of nostalgia. Each level is part of a movie with its own unique genre and look inspired by the biggest blockbusters of the 80s. See if you can spot all the references to your favorite fictional professors of archaeology, space wizards, and retired soldiers on the run from the law!",
