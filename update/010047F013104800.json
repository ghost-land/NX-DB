The clock never stops as you attempt to manage an extremely limited inventory with a murderous horde on the hunt. Choose between acquiring additional weapons, healing items, or necessary tools for progression. Play through the Campaign and Onslaught Modes alone or with a friend in local co-op, including the option for AI teammates. Also experience small survivor horror vignettes in the Nightmares mode. You have only one life. Make it count!",
