    "description": "Take part in a roller coaster of emotions with Louise embarking on a road trip of a lifetime through the late 1960s USA, trying to show her son Mitch how to navigate the often cruel modern world.\n\nWhat Does It Take To Be A Mother?\n\nTelling good from bad was never easy, all the less when you're a single mum in her late 20s with a clever 8-year-old under your care. Each choice you make in the crucial few moments we all know may change our lives for good in a split of a second, influence what kind of person Mitch turns out to be and what values shall guide him once he becomes his own man.\n\nWhy Are You Who You Are?\n\nFind clues as to why Louise’s life is what it is today, take crucial decisions no other person would be strong enough to stomach and show Mitch what he needs to see in order for him to become independent, suave and brave enough to conquer the day.\n\nEverything Has Consequences\n\nYour decisions REALLY matter! To keep track of Mitch’s growth as a person, each choice you make adds positive or negative points to three key statistics: Righteousness, Confidence, and Relations. These influence which type of ending Mitch will reach at the end of the game - there are 9 unique endings in total!\n\nEverybody Has Their Story\n\nThe 1960s were tumultuous in more ways than one - the Summer of Love, the Vietnam War, the survivors and the losers of the great upheaval in history.\nCanned Heat was “Going Up the Country” while Bob Dylan asked “How does it feel” to have no home and live on the street.\nTravel across the country and meet a plethora of characters that may help or may dissuade Louise from her goals - including the most controversial groups many thought long gone.",
