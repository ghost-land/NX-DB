    "description": "Command a group of warriors as Serenoa, heir of House Wolffort, in a tangled plot where your decisions make all the difference and key choices will influence the story. When faced with truly momentous decisions, your advisors will weigh in by casting their votes on the Scales of Conviction. Persuade them before their vote is cast to help forge your own path ahead. Remember, your allies and decisions can change the fate of Norzelia itself.\n\nControl multi-tiered terrain to strategically secure victory\n\nFinding the best location on multi-tiered maps can tip the tides in your favor. Position units on higher ground to gain the advantage. You can also flank enemies on both sides, then strike from behind for a powerful follow-up attack. Elemental chain reactions are also an important part of combat. For example, use fire to melt icy terrain, then use lightning to electrocute it. See sparks fly in stunning HD-2D visuals as you shock any opponents standing in the water! \n\nBolster your convictions and discover multiple paths through the story\n\nEach decision you make will bolster one of three convictions—Utility, Morality, or Liberty—which together make up Serenoa’s worldview and influence who will join you and lend their talents to you. Each party member has a range of distinct skills, so consider which convictions might attract certain characters. Play through the game multiple times to see how other choices impact the adventure.",
