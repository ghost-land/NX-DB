    "description": "Rebel Cops is a spin-off game from This Is the Police, which exclusively features the series' turned-based tactical operations. Lead a rag-tag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new criminal power, and see how long you can hold out when you're constantly short on supplies, and a single shot can cost a cop his life.\n\n - Youâ€™re not exactly the police, but you're the only ones on the side or justice\n\n- Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key\n\n- Explore, scavenge, and watch your back  \n\n- Take the high road, or the low road\n",
