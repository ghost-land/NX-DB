    "description": "\"Pixel Game Maker Series JEWELiNX is a retro-flavored falling object puzzle game.\nIt's a puzzle game with a simple rule: if you put two blocks of the same type in a row or on top of each other, they disappear.\nHowever, if two blocks are easily erased, a penalty gauge will accumulate and a block in the way will appear.\nIt's a little different from the traditional falling puzzle games, where you have to pile up the blocks in order to keep them from disappearing.\n\nThe \"Pixel Game Maker Series\" is a series of games created using the action game creation software \"Pixel Game Maker MV\" that can be enjoyed on the Nintendo Switch.",
