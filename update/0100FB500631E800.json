The modules have effect to specific parts of the weapons: type of bullet, number of bullets, rate of fire and other mutators.\n\nProcedurally Generated\nDuring a run, the system can detect the intrusion and modify the game, so player must act quickly!\n\nBoss Battle\nThere are not only \"small\" enemies. Atomine must also defeat big and powerful bosses.",
