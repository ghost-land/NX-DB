    "description": "When you race, does it almost feel like you’re flying? It could just be the anti-gravity effect of the new Zero Gravity Checkpoint module! Place it on the track and cross the checkpoint to see your car lift off the ground and float in the air. But don't worry, you'll be right back with your wheels on the asphalt and a fully loaded boost, because at zero gravity the boost's reload speed will skyrocket! The perfect module for fans of super dynamic and unpredictable races. Get ready to defy the laws of physics and have fun with Zero Gravity Checkpoint, a module you cannot miss!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 3",
