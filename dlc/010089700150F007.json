    "description": "This downloadable content unlocks the Shinobi and Witch as playable characters.\n\n●Shinobi\nA young man in the Dragonblood Clan. He bears the Dragonscar on his legs.\n\nThe power of the Astral Dragon Atruum allows him to use his powerful legs for both offense and enhanced movement.\n\nThe Shinobi is capable of wall jumps, hovering mid-air, double jumps and the special Dragon Dash. He combines these movement options with attacks using his Dragon Legs to deal massive damage to enemies.\n\nWhen he collides with an enemy using the Dragon Dash, he will lock-on to them for a short time, causing all of his attacks to deal more damage and automatically home-in on his target.\n\n●Witch\nA young woman in the Dragonblood Clan, and also said to be the clan's last magic user. She bears the Dragonscar on her head.\n\nAtruum's power is imbued into her hair, strengthening the magic power she uses by incanting a variety of spells.\n\nThe Witch is able to use the dragon's power to further enhance her magic, putting her into a trance-like state where she can unleash a spell multiple times with only one incantation. Few foes can withstand a skillfully unleashed onslaught of her magic.\n\nHer magic is not only limited to attacks. She can also act in a support role, creating platforms in mid-air, illuminating dark areas, and healing her allies.",
