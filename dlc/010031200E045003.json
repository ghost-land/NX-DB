    "description": "Turn back the clock with a delightful collection of 26 new retro and vintage items to place in your hospitals.\n\nWind back the years, and actual magnetic tape, with the Reel-to-Reel, or let patients relive their misspent youth with the Pinball Machine. \n\nThe more flamboyant sitters will find themselves at home with the Peacock Chair. Fancy proving you’re healthier and stronger than all of the sickly patients in your hospital? \n\nPlay the classics (from before they were ruined with all of the wub and the dub) with the vintage Jukebox. Or feel like the one true barber by basking in the twisty light of the Hypno-Pole.\nThe pre-cursor to the selfie revolution? Strike a pose like you’re a superstar in the Vanity Chamber. Then there’s the Charity Dog, a very good boy.",
