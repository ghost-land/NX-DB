    "description": "Skin Pack #4 includes the following skins:\n\nAi-Mo To Lï \nQuetzali Iqaruz\nYadakk Ürkaz\n\nAi-Mo To Lï \nThe To Lï rigorously train their bodies and minds among their sturdy Binba forests. They’ve been summoned from their temples and gyms to aid the Ai-Mo in the war, as few can match their sheer strength and discipline.\n\n\nQuetzali Iqaruz\nThe Quetzali may worship the birds, but the Iqaruz have taken their devotion a step further by trying to transform themselves into actual birds, with wings and all. Some are even attempting to fly, so they can meet the Bird Gods in the sky, but it rarely ends well.\n\nYadakk Ürkaz\nThe Ürkaz from the Khalee Highlands are known as a gruff and unfriendly group that controls the Yadakk's criminal underground. Smuggling, racketeering.",
