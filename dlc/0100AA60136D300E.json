    "description": "Lasso the competition and dominate the race like a real Amazon! Here is a super aerodynamic speedster inspired by one of the most beloved DC Comics characters ever: Wonder Woman™! \nIts beautiful livery echoes the colors and design of her legendary costume, with the golden star-tiara on the roof and the iconic double W on the hood.\n\nAnd what about performance? Well, we know that the Amazons were excellent horse riders, but here we are talking about tons of horsepower: push down on the gas pedal and earn your place among the gods of the race. It's no wonder you can't wait to drive it!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 1\n",
