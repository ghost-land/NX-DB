    "description": "Make new adventures in the land of Talisman with these 3 exciting expansions.\n\nOne of the biggest expansions for Talisman, The Dragon adds new mechanics focused around 3 returning draconic lords. These 3 mighty dragons fight to become the Dragon King, and are happy to tear the world apart in order to do so! This expansion also features new endings, a new overlay for the board and 6 new characters.\n\nAdventurers beware, the werewolf is on the prowl in The Blood Moon expansion. This new NPC stalks the board, attacking unwary adventurers and turning them into more werewolves. Also introduced in this expansion is the day/night cycle. Enemies will be stronger once night falls, so be alert!\n\nAdventure into a new region in The Highland expansion, guarded by the mighty Eagle King. Make your way to the highest peak in this new region in search of treasures, but donâ€™t expect it to be an easy climb. With new highland cards to encounter, all-new dangers will be trying to stop you at every turn, before you battle the mighty Eagle King himself.\n\nEach expansion included in this pack comes with new characters to play, new adventure cards and new creatures to encounter. Each expansion can also be enabled or disabled individually, depending on how you want to play!",
