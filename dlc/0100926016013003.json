    "description": "Dive right into an aquatic cleaning adventure, pooling the seriously satisfying gameplay of PowerWash Simulator with the nautical nonsense of SpongeBob SquarePants.\nThe residents of Bikini Bottom are left wondering what in the name of Davy Jones’ locker happened to their tidy tidal town after a myriad of mysteriously mucky mishaps. Can they get to the bottom of it before it devolves into another mud-slinging match between Mr. Krabs and Plankton? Hear from a host of familiar characters whilst you clean as they ponder what, or who, is dirtying their digs.\nExclusively in this Special Pack, you’ll get a marine makeover, allowing you to blend in with the crowd as a true Bottomite. Featuring custom-designed equipment that could rival even Sandy Cheeks’ best inventions, you can rest ashore-d that it’ll work just fine underwater. How? All you need is a power washer and some imagination.\nWash and explore six new levels, including:\n-\tConch Street – comprising SpongeBob, Squidward and Patrick’s homes\n-\tThe Krusty Krab and its rivalling restaurant Chum Bucket\n-\tThe bustling Bikini Bottom Bus\n-\tThe plush Patty Wagon\n-\tThe elusive Invisible Boatmobile\n-\tThe mysterious Mermalair",
