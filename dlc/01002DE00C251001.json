    "description": "Notice: 100% of 11 bit studios and Dead Mage's proceeds go to the Humane Society International charity!\n\nHunters of the night, creatures of the day. They howl, growl, hiss and grumble - but more than anything, they feel and think in a similar way that we all do. And their lives are as precious as ours. This DLC adds new features to the game - like the Animal Shelter System, new boosts, animations and events - but it actually does far more than that. It directly helps the animals in need - not those virtual, but the real ones. 100% of 11 bit studios and Dead Mage proceeds from Paws and Claws DLC go to the Humane Society International charity, whose main mission is to help animals all over the world.
