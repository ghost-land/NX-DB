    "description": "The early 90s were a time of great change. Bits were doubled. Buttons were tripled. Power became...super power. And amidst it all, a seventh mode was introduced, bringing scaling and rotation abilities that threatened to blow our little minds to bits. But none of this would've had the lasting impact it did were it not for a sound chip that was just as mighty. And as luck would have it, this DLC pack offers the entire Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness soundtrack in said magical format—the \"SFC\" sound chip format—recorded on authentic hardware by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro!\n\nGo to Options → Sound Settings from the main menu to change the game's sound chip.\n\nThis DLC also includes 20 additional campaign stages as part of the Bonus Scenario D story, plus new skills for the Mage and Prince characters!\n\n* This DLC is included in the Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness DLC Discount Bundle (DLC Packs 1-4) and the Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Ultimate Deluxe Bundle (Main Game + All DLC), sold separately. Please take care not to re-purchase the same content.",
