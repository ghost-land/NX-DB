    "description": "New DLC makes a grand entrance into The Wonderful 101: Remastered!\n\nInstall “The Prince Vorkken” DLC to unlock a new mode that lets you change the main player character to Prince Vorkken Ohgee, heir to the throne of the comet Rhullo and leader of the star-spanning Guyzoch Space Pirates! As Prince Vorkken, the Multi-Unite ability is replaced with “Enemy-Unite,” which summons a host of “Unify Monster” alien beasts!\n\n\"The Prince Vorkken\" also works with the free Time Attack DLC. Use Prince Vorkken’s Enemy Unite to carve out a new path, and perhaps a faster time!\n\n*Players can switch freely between normal mode and The Prince Vorkken mode after installing “The Prince Vorkken” DLC.",
