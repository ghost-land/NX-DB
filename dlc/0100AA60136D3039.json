    "description": "Dedicated to the greatest archenemy in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles universe, this car is beautifully evil, from head to toe… or should we say \"\"foot\"\". Spoilers and wings? Ha, please… Its body is enhanced by a sturdy armor of blades and claws, perfect for shredding its rivals. Like the character it is inspired by, Shredder has an aggressive line and a ruthless personality.\n\nWith a metallic look, the iconic mask and the purple cape featured on the hood, this vehicle will be the most feared opponent on the track (not only for the Turtles) and will demonstrate its ruthless skills guiding you to victory!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 3",
