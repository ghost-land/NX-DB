    "description": "A wind blows through the land of Talisman that chills adventurers to the bone. The Ice Queen has weaved new magic to bring an eternal winter. Will you be left frozen by her touch?\n\nWant to add some challenge to your next Talisman: Digital Edition adventure? With this Legendary Deck, you can increase the difficulty of cards youâ€™ll encounter from The Frostmarch Expansion. This expansion replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of the Frostmarch Expansion, redesigned to offer extra challenge for hardcore Talisman players.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the original Frostmarch Expansion in order to use this Legendary Deck.\n\nGiven new power by the Ice Queen herself, the monsters of the Frostmarch are more threatening than ever.\n\nSome of the deadly creatures that make up the Frostmarch have been given favour by the Ice Queen, granting them the ability to destroy any adventurer who stands in their way.\n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This includes cards providing less support, making your journey through the Dungeon even more treacherous.\n\nAll Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
