Colonists initially start at sea and later are recruited in player-controlled Cities. In addition, this map changes the Sea movement mechanics. \nCyprvs is a large 30 City map with 12 Provinces. While it doesnâ€™t introduce any additional mechanics the number of Cities and Provinces poses a whole new chalenge in itself!\n\nFish out new challenges in your Concordia games today!",
