    "description": "Amira Rashid is a fierce woman who's always ready to take on any challenge.\nOz is a nervous smol bean who's trying his best.\nVicky Schmidt is an energetic dork who's always ready to help other people.\nBrian Yu is... just Brian -- and we love him because of it! Such a chill dude.\n\nYou've probably known them for a long time, but only as avatars for players to control. And yet... they're their own people too. They're fully fleshed-out characters with their own fears and dreams.\n\nHaven't you ever wondered what they think and feel when they're not just playable characters?\n\nThis DLC turns the tables and brings these four beloved characters on as hitchhikers you can pick during your road trip. Thanks to their conversations, road events, endings, and deep conversations, you might get to REALLY know them in whole new depths.\n\nAlso... this character pack includes a brand new song. Warning: you may love it.\n\nYou've played as them; you've related to them; you've even become them... but are you ready to date them?",
