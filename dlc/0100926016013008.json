    "description": "The once vivid kingdom of Wonderland has found itself doused in detritus - the calamitous aftermath of the biggest threat the realm has ever seen… a curious little girl.\n\nTake a trip down the rabbit hole to uncover a topsy-turvy, swizzy, whirly world of psychedelic colours, maximalist décor and larger than life locales.\n\nYou’ll not always be sure what it is you’re washing – is it a carpet or a clock? A carrot or a cup? Sure, you’ll wash walls and tables and floors, but here even the doors have doors. And if you find your mind wander as you power wash and ponder “what does a caterpillar wear to bed?”, you might just look up to find the answer directly ahead. \n\nFact is fickle, but fiction is fate – your destiny is fixed for big things. Royal things. Big, royal things, as you clean your way through quirky and quaint homes, you’ll tread a muddy path all the way to throne, visiting:\n\n•\tWonderland’s Entrance Hall\n•\tWhite Rabbit’s House\n•\tCaterpillar’s Mushroom\n•\tMad Tea Party\n•\tQueen of Heart’s Court \n\nAn all-new outfit, gloves and power washer skin await you in Wonderland, you wouldn’t want to be underdressed for the tea party of the century! Or late, for that matter – what are you waiting for?\n\nCan you clean up and find favour, or will the Queen’s malice for Alice extend to you?",
