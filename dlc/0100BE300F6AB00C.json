    "description": "Want to add some challenge to your next Talisman: Digital Edition adventure? With the Legendary Deck for The Reaper Expansion, you can increase the difficulty of cards youâ€™ll encounter when playing with this expansion.\n\nThis Legendary Deck replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of the Reaper Expansion, with the new cards being designed to offer extra challenge for hardcore Talisman players.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the Reaper Expansion in order to use this Legendary Deck.\n\nWhat is in the legendary deck?\n\nNot all creatures fear the Reaper, and some monsters have used the abundance of death as a chance to gain even more strength. \n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This includes cards providing less support than they originally would, making your journey through the lands of Talisman even more treacherous.\n\nAll Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
