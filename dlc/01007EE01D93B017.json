    "description": "In \"Chickempic,\" the multiplayer mode of Viviter where you can play with up to 8 players, we're adding the \"Ninjutsu FUSUMA\" mini-game!\nIt seems the lord has once again fallen asleep without closing the fusuma... This won't do; it must be quite chilly.\nIf by chance the lord were to catch a cold, it would be quite troublesome. Leave it to us, the shinobi.\nThe art of stealthily closing the fusuma is a ninja technique. With this, the lord should be able to sleep soundly without even noticing.",
