    "description": "Inns & Cathedrals introduce a more strategic gameplay to Carcassonne. With new meeples, buildings and 18 new tiles, the game features even tougher choices each turn.\n\n• Add Inns to your roads to double their point value…or lose everything if you can’t finish them.\n• Build majestic Cathedrals at the heart of your cities to increase their scoring… as long as you complete said cities.\n• Place your new Large meeples, counting as two of your usual workers! But you only have one so make it count.\n\nIt is possible to combine this expansion with others for an even wilder game!",
