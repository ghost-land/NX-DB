    "description": "A new single-player campaign, Side Order, super jumps to Splatoon™ 3 in the second wave of this DLC*. Step into the role of Agent 8, a young Octoling who defected from the Octarians. See what’s become of Inkopolis Square, the central area featured in the Splatoon 2 game, and...hey, what’s Pearl doing here? And why is she a flying drone?\n\nSplat your way up the Spire of Order, where you never quite know what each floor will bring. Build your Palette of color chips to expand your arsenal and abilities as you go. Each floor gets increasingly tough, but don't worry—Side Order is meant to be played through again and again. With each run, you'll acquire more Prlz (pronounced pearlz) to spend on permanent upgrades to make the next run a little easier. You'll need every edge you can get if you want to survive to the 30th floor!",
