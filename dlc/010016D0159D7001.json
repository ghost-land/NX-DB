No sheep would dare defy you if you were the clever Cleopatra. What tree could fling you off a cliff if you were Superman? Ok, maybe those things would still happen, but it’s all about how you feel in a skin of a powerful person. Dress for success, right? With the 4 unique skins in the Powerful People Pack you’re sure to get the job done!\n\nLumberhill is a crazy multiplayer party game in which lumberjacks try to get their tasks done while nature fights them every step of the way. Race against the clock, fulfill tasks, fight wildfires, pirates, and extremely annoying monkeys as you travel around the world and through time.\n",
