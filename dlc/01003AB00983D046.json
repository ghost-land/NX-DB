    "description": "Long ago, when he was still in his early adulthood, Nitro spent his days doing odd jobs that needed muscle. One of these stints was fighting in the local wrestling league. In his biggest match to date he accidentally pulled off the mask of his opponent and an opportunistic thief made off with it mid-match. Nitro immediately stopped fighting and vowed to continue the fight only when he returned it. And he left and never returned. Some say he is still looking for the mask to finish that legendary match.\n\n- The Shining-Gold Super Winner colorway. A golden champion's outfit.\n- The Revenge Ultimatum Lucha colorway. A hellish red look.",
