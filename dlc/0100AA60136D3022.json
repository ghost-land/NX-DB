    "description": "Beauty is its strength! Obviously, we are talking about Vega's vehicle that, just like the Spanish Ninja who inspired it, makes aesthetic perfection its secret weapon. \nIt's a racing car with an aerodynamic design that recalls a Formula 1 with an aggressive double front wing, characterized by the famous white mask of Vega and its formidable claws on the side.\n\nVanity might even be a sin, but how not to brag about all the victories that HOT WHEELS™ - Street Fighter Vega will bring you? Watch your opponents surrender and cross the finish line… Have you ever seen anything more beautiful?\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 2",
