    "description": "Want to add some challenge to your next Talisman: Digital Edition adventure? With this Legendary Deck, you can increase the difficulty of cards youâ€™ll encounter from The City Expansion. This expansion replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of The City Expansion, redesigned to offer extra challenge for hardcore Talisman players.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the original City Expansion in order to use this Legendary Deck.\n\nTimes are harder in the City, and everyone needs to make ends meet - so the shops have adjusted their prices to be higher.\n\nTwo of the creatures who stalk the roads of the city have been given strength and craft beyond the mightiest adventurers. Beware if you draw these cards!\n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This includes cards providing less support, making your journey through the City even more treacherous. All Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
