    "description": "As beautiful and powerful as the Street Fighter character she is inspired by, Chun-Li is ready to make her way onto the track with her agility. She is M. Bison's sworn enemy, but she will have no mercy on any rival! \n\nThe car's appearance recalls the traditional Chinese dress worn by Chun-Li, with a blue body and golden details while the sides feature the iconic double buns that made her hairstyle famous. \nChun-Li in Chinese means \"Beautiful Spring\" and for you it means that a wonderful season... of races is about to start! Add it to your collection, it's definitely the winning move!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 2",
