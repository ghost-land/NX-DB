    "description": "New Yuck Threats team\nThe Threats have done a great job of building around QB Stack Killson and infusing talent on both sides of the ball. With three #1 picks in this year’s draft, they added speed on the offense and nastiness on the D-Line. The secondary covers like a blanket and stings like a bee with the additions of D.J. Bleed Jr. and Saucy Charredner. This is a hungry young team ready to take off.\n\nThreatLife Stadium\nPlay against or as the Threats at ThreatLife Stadium, which isn’t called “ThreatLife” for nothing - with two buzz saws, more landmines than a mind field, and blood-filled moats this field threatens your life for real.\n\nTheme Song\nATTITUDE!\nBy DEETRANADA.\nCourtesy of PlusMusic",
