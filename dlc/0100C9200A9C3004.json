Thanks to 24 new tiles, 2 new kinds of meeples and a new collection mechanic, your games will be more varied than ever! \n\n• Collect commodities by finishing cities, the more you can hoard, the more points you will get! This works even if the cities are not yours, it’s just good business after all.\n\n• Outplay your opponents with the Builders, giving you an extra turn when you add a tile to either a town or road that your Builder occupies. \n\n• Finally, the Pig will improve your points whilst in a field with one of your worker. Score like never before!\n\nIt is possible to combine this expansion with others for an even wilder game!",
