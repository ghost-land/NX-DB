Once all challenges and trials have been bested, Link will obtain a new power known as the Master Cycle Zero!\n\nAdditionally, the bard Kass is traveling Hyrule to complete the unfinished song his teacher left behind. As Link and Kass chase their respective goals, Kass will share new original songs he wrote capturing lost memories of the four Champions and Zelda, previously unknown to Link.
