    "description": "Clean up your messy nebula with the Tydy DLC! Tydy adds a whole new org to Void Bastards as well as a brutal new weapon, a fiendishly dangerous new opponent, new ships to loot and the opportunity to collect additional heart starters, giving you a chance to keep your favourite client alive or beat that ironman challenge.\n\nTydy vans roam the nebula dispensing neat-freak Tydy bots into every ship they visit. Although Tydy bots aren’t hostile, to them you’re just another dirty, dirty object to be vacuumed clean. Unfortunately for you, Tydy vacuums sucks the very air out of your lungs, making it hard to hang around.\n\nThe good news is that parts from Tydy ships can be repurposed by clever clients and used to build your own vacuum device: the whackuum. The whackuum not only dishes out damage to your enemies, it can suck blood from citizens and slag out of mechanical foes. It’s a double whammy!\n\nBut perhaps the choicest delight that Tydy offers up is the chance to rip out an ignition plug from a combustion chamber on a Tydy furnace ship. This plug can easily be turned into a makeshift heart starter, giving you that jolt back to life when you’ve been living life on the edge. Watch out though, because the furnace is a dangerous place…\n\nRumour has it that other goodies can be recovered from Tydy ships due to the large amount of discarded junk that the Tydy bots have been known to collect.",
