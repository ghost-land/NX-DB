    "description": "From Hogsport to Blighton, from Flemington to Smogley, from here to remote corners of the Wanderoff County Park, everyone is talking about Mother Nature.\n\nTabitha Windsock, Two Point County’s every-present mayor, has put rivers and forests back on the map with her sudden concern for ‘green-issues’. She’s got morals, integrity and, above all else, a cloying desperation to stay in office.\n\nThat’s right, voter research has repeatedly suggested that the environment is the No. 1 issue on everyone’s mind, here in Two Point County, and Ms Windsock is more than willing to fall on the sword of extensive positive press by founding the Department of Green Things.\n\nYou’ll face new illnesses, some of them bizarre, even by your standards, and manage new gameplay mechanics on your route to eco-friendly success. We believe in you, and Tabitha does too (sort of).",
