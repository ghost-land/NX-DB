Those scholars who were focused on research also began to feel uneasy, as if something uncontrollable was happening.\n\nA hidden plane exists at the Pavilion of Spirits, the secret base of three mysterious persons. Countless arcane implements brimming with energy riddle the area. This plane is called the [Pavilion of Darkness], the Reincarnation Trial's greatest secret.\n\nA mysterious person used an ancient technique to create eight beings from Soul Crystals. These beings became known as the Charim.\n\nWhile possessing their original memories, the Soul Crystals have distorted the Charim into beings of pure hatred and violence. The trial they undergo within the dark dimension is known as the Incarnation of Darkness. Should a Charim grow powerful enough, they can break free and cross the boundaries between dimensions to exact the revenge they so vehemently seek.\n\n[Incarnation of Darkness]\nThe Incarnation of Darkness DLC comes with its own difficulty level. Anything can happen as the difficulty intensifies; the possibilities are endless.\n\n[8 Charim Characters]\nThese brand-new characters come with unique weapons and talents. They are mighty indeed. But with great power comes great responsibilityâ€”the trials they face are even more terrifying.\n\n[16 New Relics]\nAs the Charim gains further strength, each will unlock 2 new relics for a total of 16.\n\n\nThe Reincarnation Trial to save the world is going in a strange direction, will it bring hope or destruction?",
