    "description": "Welcome to The Rock, Wardens!\n\nPrison Architect: Island Bound introduces more ways to build and manage your prison.\n\nSea and Air: Use a variety of ferry and helicopter transports to deliver supplies and inmates directly to docking areas around your compound. However, there are also more access points to sneak contraband into the prison.\n\nChain Link Up: Maximize your prisonâ€™s efficiency by linking docks, helipads, and roads to specific deliveries. Toggle what services are available to each delivery point within your compound.\n\nSupermax Security: New security objects make it easier to search deliveries and prisoners. Additional emergency services can also be called when things get out of hand.\n\nIsland Life: Customize your island with over 15 nautical tiles and objects. Shape the land around your compound with moats, rivers, and lakes for security, or for style -- no access roads needed!\n\nThe Rock: Manage the infamous Alcatraz Prison and Alcatraz Island with two premade maps.",
