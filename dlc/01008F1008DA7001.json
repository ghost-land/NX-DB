    "description": "\"THE BLOOD...I MUST HAVE THE BLOOD!\"\n\nDarkest Dungeon®: The Crimson Court is the first expansion for the award-winning grim and gothic RPG by Red Hook Studios. Crimson Court is a parallel campaign experienced alongside the main Darkest Dungeon content that will provide you with new challenges and variation at every difficulty level. The narrative grounding sheds some light on the Ancestor’s early days, and will be presented in the same style of cut-scenes you’ve seen elsewhere in the game.\n\nThe DLC is designed to be played alongside an existing campaign, or as a brand new one--your choice! The events and features will unlock over the course of play.\n\nFeatures:\n• A new hero class. “Awash in blood and delusion, they bear the burden of a thousand lifetimes.”\n• A new dungeon region: The Courtyard\n• A full faction of new deadly foes\n• 5 new Bosses with some of the most complex and devious mechanics yet.\n• A new wandering boss: The Fanatic\n• Districts: 10 new buildings to upgrade your Hamlet\n• Massive, sprawling maps with locked doors, prisoner rooms, and progress saves\n• Lore-driven trinket sets for all heroes - with set bonuses!",
