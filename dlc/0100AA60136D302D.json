    "description": "Metal Maniacs rejoice! Tork Maddox's legendary car joins the fray, a muscle car super modified to resist everything and everyone. And that's what makes it so irresistible! \n\nNot surprisingly Hollowback™ is one of the few cars in the acclaimed series (and the only one of the Metal Maniacs) that has never been damaged or destroyed. And how could it be? I mean, did you have a good look at it? This racing car is made of pure solidity and, with its V8 engine, it will make its way through all the opponents on its path, leaving a void behind (staying true to its name). \nA must-have for all AcceleRacers fans that should be present in every collection!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 2",
