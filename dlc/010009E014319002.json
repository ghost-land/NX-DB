    "description": "We all love Zoe, don't we?\n\nShe's passionate about her interests. She's excited 24/7. She's a lover of many fandoms, always writing a fanfic or drawing fanart. \nShe's snarky, chaotic, and ultimately good-hearted. She's more than ready to explore her own truth and be unapologetically herself.\nWe love her partly because she's like us. We love her partly because she's what we'd like to be.\n\nThat's the charm of our beloved and adorkable eldritch cutie.\nIn a way, she IS us.\nSo maybe... today we can be her.",
