    "description": "The SSS is set in Barcelona's magnificent historic district. The circuit winds around different monuments. Its winding, technical roads give drivers a real challenge, and on two occasions they have to negotiate donuts during the stage. \nThe Barcelona SSS is also famed for drawing a big crowd of spectators. They come to see the show unfolding on the tarmac, with them in the middle of the action. A real treat for fans, and a chance to see their favourite cars and drivers up close! ",
