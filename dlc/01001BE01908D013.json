    "description": "Deezel Riggs' second car in the AcceleRacers series, the Piledriver™ takes its name from a ruthless wrestling move that leaves no opponents a chance: they are flipped and crushed to the ground. Likewise, Piledriver™ can turn any situation around and take out the competition on the track in an instant. An open-structure single-seater that reveals the engine and NO2 tanks for extra power.\nTechnetium™ is instead a beauty from Team Silencerz that needs no introduction. Actually, it would need it, but many of its characteristics remain a mystery, as per Silencerz tradition. The only thing that won't be a mystery is that it will take you straight to the podium!\nAdd AcceleRacers Free Pack 2 to your collection!\n\nThis DLC includes:\n- Piledriver™\n- Technetium™",
