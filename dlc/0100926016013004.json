Crank that water pressure to 88 miles per hour and travel back in time to hose down iconic movie sets from the Back to the Future trilogy!\n \nThe future may be ‘heavy’, but the past sure is dirty. You’ve arrived on set in the nick of time to make every legendary location sparkle and every prop ‘pop’, even if it takes a whole 1.21 gigawatts of pressure washing power! \n\nWith filming schedules running tight, you’re in for one electrifying ride to spray down everything from the Time Machine to the Holomax Theater before you’re “OUTATIME”.\n\nMake power wash history by blasting every spec of dirt and grime from heavy use, debris from explosive scenes and temporal ice from... well, we’re not actually sure where that came from. \n \nWash and explore five new levels:\n-\tDoc Brown’s Van\n-\tTime Machine\n-\tHill Valley Clocktower\n-\tHolomax Theater\n-\tDoc’s Time Train\n\nWell, better get to it! There’s no time like the present! Or the past, or the future for that matter.",
