    "description": "Out of Time is a standalone adventure set within the final day of Jess' first week at her new school. On the verge of saving the world, Jess encounters Tock, the time-traveling Pipsqueak champion. Tock hurls Jess back in time, trapping her in a time loop where she is forced to relive the same school day over and over again like she was some sort of giant marmot. To add insult to injury, Jess loses her decks in the time-traveling process. Magically, Jess finds a brand new champion card in her pocket. It's Bloop! Bloop is the only neutral champion in the game, a known weakling in the Mega Mutant Power Pets realm, but perhaps Jess can do something about that?
