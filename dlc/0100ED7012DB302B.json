Soon after his anger turned to Wu, Zhang Fei is murdered. Because Cao Pi had abolished the Han dynasty, this would have been the perfect time to justify an attack on Wei. However, Liu Bei chooses to attack Wu for revenge instead. In his thirst for revenge, the words of caution from Zhao Yun and Zhuge Liang could no longer reach Liu Bei's ears.\n\nNote: Limited free distribution untilã€€February 24, 2021!\nNote: This content will not be released as paid DLC in the future.",
