    "description": "Enter the Tower of Doooom and meet its mysterious landlady, Madame Bwahstrella! Ascend the challenging tower to free your old friend Spawny in a new game mode focused on combat. Even if you can climb to the top, the end is only the beginning as you unlock new difficulty levels for infinite replayability! Build and upgrade your team throughout the expedition, plan strategically and triumph against all odds!\n\n• Choose and plan strategically: At each of the 10 floors, you have a choice between different gates presenting various levels of challenge. The greater the risk, the greater the reward, as they say! Start with only a handful of Heroes and Sparks and gather rewards at each floor to build a team strong enough to face the dangers of the Tower of Doooom. \n\n• After finishing the first expedition and saving Spawny, it’s not over: gain access to the new, increasingly difficult Challenge levels that Madame Bwahstrella has up her sleeve. Venture on harder expeditions and prove your tactical skills in a highly replayable experience. Can you make it all the way to the end?\n\n\n• There are nine exclusive weapon skins, useable in the main game, for you to unlock throughout your journey. Are you brave enough to collect them all?",
