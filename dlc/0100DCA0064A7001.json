    "description": "Something’s lurking in the halls of the ScareScraper, it’s…Groovigi!? A disco-themed outfit for ScareScraper is joined by the Mummigi and The Green Knight costumes in the Luigi’s Mansion 3 Multiplayer Pack 1, which is the first of two packs in the Luigi’s Mansion 3 Multiplayer Pack DLC. Each of these frighteningly fabulous costumes also comes with a matching Floor Theme and themed ghosts. When you aren’t scaling the ScareScraper in style, go head-to-head in the new Tricky Ghost Brawl, Dodge Brawl, and River Bank minigames for ScreamPark!",
