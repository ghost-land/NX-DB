    "description": "Darkness Among Us is a brand-new Chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, a Survivor, a Map and an exclusive item for the new survivor.\n\nThe everyday contains many hazards. But the comforts of routine shroud the unfathomable risks of a threat so intimate, so familiar, that it can only be seen in hindsight. A disturbing, violent force could be raging within the people closest to you. Darkness is among us, every day.\n\nThe raw cravings and impulses of adolescence are powerful.When three teens get involved with an impulsive mastermind, they discover an addictive kind of freedom. Together, they spiral out of control and become the wrong kind of crowd, The Legion, which leaves no rule unbroken. \n\nJeff Johansen was invited to take a trip down memory lane when his past caught up with him. He returned to his hometown, ready to face everything he was forced to leave behind. Itâ€™s never too late to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n",
