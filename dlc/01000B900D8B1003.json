    "description": "Don a variety of masks to change Skull Kid’s weapons and abilities on the fly as he tries to overcome a melodic menace! The Symphony of the Mask story is Skull Kid's debut in this game, but you can use him in the main story and other game modes, too.\n\n\nChallenge a cacophony of cruel creatures in Arena Mode\n\nOvercome increasingly-strong enemies as you battle through as many floors as possible. The items, weapons, and abilities on each floor are random, so your arsenal may differ each playthrough!\n\nPut your rhythm—and wit—to the test in Puzzle Mode\n\nThe music-based gameplay of the Cadence of Hyrule – Crypt of the NecroDancer Featuring The Legend of Zelda game meets the traditional puzzle-solving from the Legend of Zelda series. Solve your way through a dungeon full of brain teasers and puzzles for a noggin-scratching challenge.\n",
