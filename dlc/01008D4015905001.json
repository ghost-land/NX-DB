    "description": "Age was exploring a portal in the Frontier Shelter when he was suddenly moved to what appears to be a laboratory by an unknown force. It seems to be a laboratory of the Frontier meant for testing creatures, filled with many devices to measure and record combat capabilities and strengthen their shortcomings. All experimental subjects created from these repeated experiments are beings who seek perfection, created solely from data.\n\nAge becomes a reincarnation constantly reborn by Helvis in the laboratory each time a 'different Age' participates in an experiment... An experiment that cannot be escaped until it is fully completed. Will Age be able to escape from the 'Rebirth Project'?\n\n-- Improved convenience for various weapons\nIn the 'Rebirth Project', synastries of the original episode such as the Katana, which is strong against living creatures and the Claymore, which is strong against robots, have been modified to deal more damage. The advantages of the synastry remain unchanged, while the damage reduction has been eliminated.\nThanks to this, you shouldn't feel any disadvantage or discomfort in any situation you encounter or due to what blade you use. You can freely use the blade replacement action to continue your combos.\n\n-- More powerful upgrades with rogue-like elements\nThe 'Rebirth Project' has a 'Synergy' effect that gets stronger and stronger the longer you survive.\nThe 'Modules' used to increase capabilities in the original game have been enhanced. They now offer special effects, and upgrading skills has been simplified. This allows the player to combine module and blade characteristics to create powerful combinations that weren't possible in the original game.",
