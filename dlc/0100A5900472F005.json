    "description": "Inspired by the Isle of Lewis chess set, this download pack for Chess Ultra contains an incredibly detailed set of chess pieces made from walrus ivory (virtual, of course!).\n\nThe Lewis chessmen are thought to be among the oldest chess pieces ever found.  They were discovered in 1831 on the Isle of Lewis in the Outer Hebrides, Scotland which is where their name is derived. Experts estimate they were made in the 12th century, somewhere between 1150 and 1200, in Norway or Iceland. \n\nThis pack contains a chess set only, which can be used in any environment in the game.",
