    "description": "This expansion contains two additional maps - Byzantium and Hispania - and a new trading Good - Salt, and a new Forum mechanic. The additions are modular and optional, and serve to add variety and new challenges to the game.\n\nSalt is the most valuable of all the trading Goods and can serve as a wild card - supplement any other Good in any trade. \nForum introduces a set of bonus Cards that can provide either ongoing or situational bonuses throughout the game. \nByzantium is a 28 City map with 10 Provinces and no new mechanics. \nHispania is a 23 City map with 9 Provinces and no new mechanics.\n\nSpice up your Concordia games today!",
