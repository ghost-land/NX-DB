Combine the super-soothing fun of PowerWash Simulator with the gritty and gripping world of Final Fantasy VII. \nIt takes a lot of power to clean the mess left behind by the usual suspects – Don Corneo’s lackeys, Professor Hojo’s ‘specimens’ and Heidegger’s tech.

Magic, monsters, Mako – evidence of this world’s strife is everywhere.\nFrontline in the fight against dirt, it’s down to you to restore Midgar’s metropolis back to its shining former glory, accepting commissions from all that request your PowerWashing prowess – from Shinra’s bigshots to Avalanche’s most loyal members. Discover their stories through text messages as you powerwash to a sparkling finish.\n\nWash and explore five new levels, including:\n-\tThe iconic Hardy Daytona & Shinra Hauler\n-\tThe mighty Scorpion Sentinel\n-\tThe welcoming Seventh Heaven\n-\tThe breath-taking Mako Energy Exhibit\n-\tThe formidable Airbuster",
