    "description": "Part four of the Muckingham Files series brings you two new Bonus Jobs from friends in high places. Clean up local crypto enthusiast, Devon King’s vandalised modern mansion and pilot Floraine Perez’ fire plane following a flight over Mount Rushless.\n\nResident technophile, Devon King, has made a small fortune by investing a substantially larger fortune in crypto currency, inspiring the creation of his very own ‘MuckCoin’. The builders at his newly completed mansion have protested Devon’s attempt to pay them in his new currency by defacing the place before the move-in date, and he just can’t make cents of their ire. An indebted investor might not be the wisest choice of client, but dirt is your crypto-nite - and he has a substantial deposit of it. The large, flat surfaces of the modern mansion make for super-satisfying cleaning, whilst some witty graffiti makes for great entertainment while you wash.\n\nAnother call for your cleaning services is coming in hot. Local fire plane, the Sky Whale, is in need of a proper good hose-down. Despite the name, staying aloft isn’t the problem: a serious lack of visibility is. One trip through Mount Rushless’ ominous plume has left the plane coated in a thick layer of ash. Wipe down this seriously impressive set of wings to get pilot Perez back on course. A ‘stationery supply drop’ to a neighbouring town is on the line; if that doesn’t light a fire under you, what will?!\n\nAbout the Muckingham Files\nThe Muckingham Files is a series of free updates that take you to never-before-seen places from the original universe of PowerWash Simulator, with new characters, locations and stories. Get to know more about your stomping ground and its inhabitants as the most in-demand power washer in town.",
