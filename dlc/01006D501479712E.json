    "description": "This allows you to use a special character and that character's weapon.\n\nThis hostess was chosen to join the fight from \"Dream Club,\" a club for adults that can only be joined by those with a pure heart. The rambunctious Setsu (or \"Setsu-Chan\") is known as the \"fierce tiger\" of Dream Club. She boiled with rage on hearing the planet is in trouble, and jumped at the opportunity to help. For her Ability, she sets up a bear-shaped power spot which further amplifies her fighting spirit. For her SP Move, she freezes the enemies by making a brisk snow fall from above. Her unlikely weapon is a portable railgun that needs to be charged to fire. Though it may not seem so at first, this is truly pure power to the extreme.",
