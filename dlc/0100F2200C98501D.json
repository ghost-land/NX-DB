    "description": "Growing up an orphan, Rain had limited prospects. To overcome them, he joined Edenia's army. His strategic genius earned him great fame and quick promotion. Rain used his new position to seek out his birth parents' true identities. He was shocked to learn that he was the bastard son of the god Argus, Edenia's Protector. Argus had given Rain away, and hidden his parentage, to avoid both shame and scandal. Now, armed with the knowledge that he's a half god, Rain battles for his place in Edenia's pantheon. If it's not given to him, he'll take it by force.",
