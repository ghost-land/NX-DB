    "description": "Forests, mountains and lakes have no secrets from her, and on the battlefield she is buzzing like a dragon among the clouds. But itâ€™s better not to send her to the baker for blueberry buns, because she can come home after a year with a new army at her side. And worst of all, no buns. A peaceful life is just not what she does best.\n\nAnd she speaks a language that no one understands.",
