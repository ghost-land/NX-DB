    "description": "Ever wished you grew up in Japan, where families gathered around their computers—or their disk-based console system add-ons that came equipped with an extra high-fidelity sound channel—to play the latest 8-bit masterpieces? And not just disks—some carts even came with special chips attached to enhance their musical capabilities! Which is a lot like this DLC pack, which offers the entire Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness soundtrack in new \"FDS\" and \"VRC\" sound chip formats, recorded on authentic hardware by the legendary Yuzo Koshiro!\n\nGo to Options → Sound Settings from the main menu to change the game's sound chip.\n\nThis DLC also includes 20 additional campaign stages as part of the Bonus Scenario C story, plus new skills for the Amazon and Old Guy characters!\n\n* This DLC is included in the Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness DLC Discount Bundle (DLC Packs 1-4) and the Gotta Protectors: Cart of Darkness Ultimate Deluxe Bundle (Main Game + All DLC), sold separately. Please take care not to re-purchase the same content.",
