    "description": "Dead by Daylight: Resident Evil: PROJECT W features a new Killer – Albert Wesker, The Mastermind – and new Survivors Ada Wong and Rebecca Chambers. Purchasing this add-on unlocks an exclusive charm: Green Vial. \n\nTo abide by the simple constraints of evolution is to limit true potential. A poor performance indeed. The Killer is Albert Wesker – The Mastermind– a visionary as brilliant as he is ruthless. Dead by Daylight: Resident Evil: PROJECT W also includes two new Survivors: Ada Wong and Rebecca Chambers. Dexterous and enigmatic, Ada’s survival skills make her a valuable ally, provided interests remain aligned. A S.T.A.R.S. Field Medic, Rebecca leads by example to assist those in need – even if it means facing grave danger.",
