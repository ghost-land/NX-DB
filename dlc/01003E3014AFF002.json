    "description": "Following the roads of a military tank training base, Arena Panzerplatte is one of the WRC's most iconic super special stages. Reproduced at 1:1 scale, it has also been a favourite special stage among WRC players in recent years. Traction is a constant challenge because of the frequent surface changes, while the many hinkelsteins – huge concrete slabs lining the road – leave drivers with no room for recovery if they crash.\n",
