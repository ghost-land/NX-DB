    "description": "Sinsonasty Mangles team\nThe Mangles stunned the MFL last season as the hottest Cinderella team in the league. They made it to the Mayhem Bowl and lost in a nail-biter. With the MVP-level pairing of QB Bro Shiesty and speedy WR Bizarre Ace. No team enjoys a deeper, more explosive pass-catching group than the Mangles. Now throw in a strong run game, plus a stingy and hard-hitting defense, and the Mangles have the firepower to contend with any team in the league.\n\nConcrete Jungle Stadium\nPlay against or as the Mangles in Concrete Jungle Stadium which is filled with more dangerous hazards than Sinsonastyâ€™s worst neighborhoods. Moving spikes, firepits, and mutant traps litter this urban jungle field.\n\nTheme Song\nNo Place to Hide\nWritten by: John Hedges Ross \nCourtesy of APM Music",
