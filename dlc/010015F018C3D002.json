    "description": "This DLC provides additional content for Horde Mode only. \n\nPrepare yourself, the invasion is expanding into the depths of the city. Deploy into two new maps and fend off rounds of relentless aliens with brand-new equipment, items, and perks. \n\n2 New Maps \nWelcome ‘Rooftop’ and ‘Hospital’. Take the fight to the picturesque city skyline or defend the wounded as aliens infest the hospital. These two stunning maps will see you repelling the invasion using intuitive built-in features. \n\nNew Weapon – Medic Gun \nThis gun will restore health when you shoot it at one of your buddies, but don’t worry – it still afflicts damage when you fire at your enemies. Talk about multi-purpose, eh? \n\nNew Item – Decoy Soldier \nThis item will deploy a cardboard cut-out of a soldier that attracts aliens. The General let us in on a secret - it’s a fantastic way of grouping aliens for your explosive weapons. \n\nNew Item – Ice Maker \nFun fact - these aliens really dislike the cold. Too bad for them. The ‘Ice Maker’ is a surefire way of slowing down the horde while causing freeze damage. \n\nNew Perk – Resurrection perk \nPerfect for solo players, with this perk you no longer must wait for a friend to revive you. This will resurrect you instantly, meaning you can join the fight once more!",
