    "description": "Get behind the wheel of the strongest and most powerful car in the universe! From the acclaimed animated series Masters of the Universe here is the car of Prince Adam... oops sorry, that's a secret... we meant He-Man™! \nTough, agile and super fast, this off-road muscle car was born to be a hero. The famous blond bob hairstyle on the roof, the armor on the hood, the battle axe as rear spoiler and the legendary Power Sword on the sides of the body faithfully reproduce the look of one of the most beloved characters of all time. \n\nShow off its muscles on the track and defend the first position with the same energy He-Man™ protects Castle Grayskull from the evil Skeletor or any other rival crazy enough to get in its way. \nBy the power of Grayskull, you have the power… to collect it now!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 3",
