    "description": "You can now play “NINE TILES” in “Let’s Play! Oink Games”\n\nWhen playing with friends, as long as 1 person owns the game, the other players do not need to own it to play.\n\n● NINE TILES\nMove or flip over your 9 tiles as much as you want and try to be the fastest to rearrange your tiles according to the theme. The rules are simple enough, but if you don't pay attention to the pattern on the backside of your tiles too, you won't be able to complete you set smoothly. This is a speedy-party-puzzle game that is fun for all ages, from kids to adults!\n\n- Supported Players: Offline 1-4 Players, Online/Local 1-8 Players (Playable with CPU opponents)",
