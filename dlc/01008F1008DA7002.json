    "description": "The Shieldbreaker is a powerful ally in the fight to reclaim the Estate and banish the evil that squats in the Darkest Dungeon. A highly-tactical and solid damage dealing hero, she truly excels when countering monsters with high protection and those who guard their allies. Her movement, speed, and targeted abilities make her a valuable ally for dismantling intractable monster groups. Though relatively low health, the Shieldbreaker is yet highly survivable in short bursts thanks to her Aegis scales.\n\nFeatures:\n• New hero class: the Shieldbreaker\n• Shieldbreaker class-specific trinkets, including a lore set\n• 3 New Monsters - frightful illusions from the Shieldbreaker's origin, now slithering forward to infest the Estate\n• New Consumable Item - Aegis Scale, providing a last bastion of protection for when a hero truly needs it.\n",
