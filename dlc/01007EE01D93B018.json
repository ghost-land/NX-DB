    "description": "In \"Chickempic,\" the multiplayer mode of Viviter where you can play with up to 8 players, we're adding the \"Chicken Jones\" mini-game!\nAs we ventured into the depths of the ruins in search of treasure, the final puzzle to guard the treasure revealed itself.\nA balance scale, stone statues... Ah, I see.\nWe need to place something on the other side of the scale that's the same size as the stone statue.\nOnce we understand that, it's simple; just draw it. Isn't that right, Junior?\nThe treasure is just around the corner.",
