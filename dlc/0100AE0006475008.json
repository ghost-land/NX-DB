    "description": "Starship Troopers™ (1997): features the license for the popular film of the same name released in 1997. Designed by Joe Balcer and Joe Kaminkow, this table conveys the style and feel of the movie with its vibrantly colored playfield, music from the movie and custom speech. The gameplay features hard core Sci-Fi action with three Flippers, high scoring Nuke 'em rounds, four unique Multi-Ball modes, a moving Warrior Bug live fire battle simulator and a Brain Bug that pops out of the playfield! Starship Troopers has appropriately been described as easy to play but hard to master.",
