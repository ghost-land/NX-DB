    "description": "Skin pack #3 includes the following skins:\n- Oumaji Khondor\n- Kickoo Ragoo\n- Zebasi Anzala\n\nOumaji Khondor\nThe ancient sacred order of Khondor Honor Guards has appeared! Hailing from the time of Mubehasi the Undefeated, the Khondor have put on their masks, mounted their Sphelix, and set out to reform the Oumaji out of nomadism and back into a more \"civilized age.\n\nKickoo Ragoo\nThe scourge of the waters, the bane of navies, the serpents of the seas - The Malo-Lo Pirates! Their many tales tell of the booty they've plundered, towns they've sacked, and ships they've sunk, and now they're ready for more as they expand their operations from the Kickoo Isles to the rest of the Square!\n\nZebasi Anzala\nThe disciples of Anzala eschewed the scientific lifestyle of their Zebasi siblings and followed the calling of art and unrestrained expression! Now theyâ€™re here, with the Square as their canvas, and no one will hinder their creative conquest!\n\nTribe skins are basically costumes for the tribe that will change an entire tribe's aesthetic from the ground up! New clothes, new buildings, new music, and sometimes even new animals! The Skins are also visible in multiplayer mode and the AI opponents will also use the skins.\n\n* Note that Tribe Skins are not actual gameplay changes, such as adding new units or abilities to the tribes. The skinned versions of tribes play the exact same way as their default skins.",
