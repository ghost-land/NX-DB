Take a vacation from Muckingham’s mainland to clean up the sun deck of Crab Bay’s cruise liner following a rather messy departure. Once you’re done, it should be smooth, sanitary sailing from there on out!\n\nTicked off tourists, fried foods and greedy gulls do not make for most folks’ idea of a dream holiday - but you are not most folks. If the destination is dirty, you’re on board! With the sun on your back and cool mist on your visor, cleaning up feels like a breeze. Say “bon voyage” to dirt as you slough off the remnants of an avian air assault, revealing the vivid sun deck beneath. Ahhh, so satisfying.\n\nWhether you take on the task as a solo traveller or bring all hands on deck in co-op, you’ll be sure to feel the winter blues defrost in this summer muckbuster!\n\nYou’ll also receive all-new summer threads to have you looking and feeling cool. Well, as cool as you physically can in a rubber suit.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n•\tWash and explore the Cruise Ship Sun Deck\n•\tNew custom summer suit\n•\tNew custom summer gloves\n•\tNew custom power washer skin\n\n\nAbout PowerWash Simulator’s Seasonal Specials\n\nPowerWash Simulator’s Seasonal Specials is a series of free content updates containing a single map themed around a season or holiday – after all, cleaning isn’t just for Spring!",
