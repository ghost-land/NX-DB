    "description": "Roll up! Roll up! Step right up and attempt to escape the most entertaining inmate compound yet! Big Top Breakout features all the bells, whistles and squirty flowers you’d expect from lifetime imprisonment in the circus. Serving your time as a clown in the travelling circus, you have to earn your keep by lion taming, face painting and making balloon animals, whilst making sure you show up for Show Time to perform for the paying circus attendees.\n\nThis wacky prison setting comes with new items to find, craft and use in order to formulate your greatest escape yet. Will you fire your way to freedom, or will you end up with custard pie all over your face and under the rule of the Strongmen and their vicious guard poodles for the rest of your days? There’s only one way to find out – stop clowning around and load up Big Top Breakout!",
