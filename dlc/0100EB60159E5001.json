Will you answer his call?\n\nNew game mode\n\nAeterna Noctis: Virtuoso features the long-awaited boss rush mode. Now players can repeat the boss fights from the base game including new enemy behaviour and attack patterns.\n\nDuring these battles, your powers will be restricted to ensure a fair duel, this way, you will also be able to perform feats that you may not have achieved in your first encounter: defeating bosses in a particular way or without getting hit.\n\nIf you prefer an even greater challenge you can face them one after the other.\n\nThe Collector is the NPC that introduces the boss rush mode to players. Visit his true collection and overcome the different challenges and boss groups until you defeat all of them in every modality.\n\nNew boss fight\n\nThe Clockwork Twins are the new bosses included in the DLC. They can be found (and beaten) in the boss rush mode, offering an encounter only recommended for the most skilled players.\n\nThis brand-new final boss features unique mechanics that will put your reflexes to the test. You must face these monstrosities in an exclusive arena.\n\nGameplay improvements\n\nWe've included a \"How to Play\" section to facilitate a shortcut to the movement and combat controls just by pausing the game and accessing this index.",
