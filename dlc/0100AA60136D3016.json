Add HOT WHEELS™ - Dinopult Module to any track and get ready to jump into the Jurassic Era with this huge red stegosaurus. \n\nRace under its belly, between its massive legs, but be careful not to get caught by its unpredictable tail: pass through at the wrong time and you will be thrown into the air losing the lead of the race! And this could mean extinction for your hope of victory! Learn how to use it to your advantage to beat your rivals and you might find yourself landing on the podium!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 1\n",
