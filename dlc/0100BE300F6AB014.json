    "description": "Want to add some challenge to your next Talisman: Digital Edition adventure? With this Legendary Deck, you can increase the difficulty of cards youâ€™ll encounter from The Blood Moon Expansion. This expansion replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of the Blood Moon Expansion, redesigned to offer extra challenge for hardcore Talisman players.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the original Blood Moon Expansion in order to use this Legendary Deck.\n\nChanged by the Blood Moon, these creatures are stronger than ever, ready to pounce on unsuspecting adventurers who wander too far into the dark of the night.\n\nChampions of the Moon, some creatures have been turned into hulking monsters who will only be defeated by the mightiest of adventurers.\n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This includes cards providing less support, making surviving each night even more treacherous. All Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
