HOT WHEELS™ - Rolling Boulders Module is an impressive boulder launcher that will add a rush of adrenaline to your race: from the base module, a giant boulder will randomly be thrown onto the track from 3 openings. You know the damage that a hail stone can do to your car? Well, now imagine a 5-meter stone! \n\nIt will take lightning fast reflexes to avoid a devastating impact! Will you be able to overcome this obstacle? Will you be blown away? Nothing is written in stone so test yourself and prove that... YOU ROCK!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 1\n",
