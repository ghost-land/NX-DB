    "description": "This downloadable content includes:\n• Gnashville Lycans Team – this is an all-werewolf team led by Dyan Rammakill at QB and a bruising power run game featuring All-Star RB Derrick Frenzy carrying the rock. On defense, the team is ferocious, and can sink its fangs into any opponent’s offense. The Lycans are rampaging beasts howling for a playoff run.\n• NewSin Stadium – play against or as the Lycans in NewSin Stadium, located deep in a dark and foreboding forest set under a full moon. This grim stadium is packed with dangerous field hazards, and cursed goal posts that make every field goal attempt a nightmare.\n• “Blood, Fur and Lightnin'” – The Lycans’ home musical theme song.",
