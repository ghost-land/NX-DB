    "description": "When the dusk turns full dark, it comes. Dead by Daylight’s Roots of Dread Chapter features a new Killer – The Dredge – and a new Survivor, Haddie Kaur. A new map, the disturbing Garden of Joy, is available for all players. Purchasing this add-on also unlocks an exclusive outfit for Haddie: The Pale Piped Shirt. \n\nThe Killer is The Dredge. A formless mass of twisted limbs writhing in the shadows, The Dredge is a manifestation of repressed darkness. All light will drain in the presence of this unsettling abomination. Look no further than the once-idyllic Garden of Joy, left forever tainted by The Dredge’s gruesome appetite.  Yet few stand bolder than Haddie Kaur. Fuelled by courage, determination, and a dash of morbid curiosity, this explorer of haunted corners leaves no stone unturned in her quest for eldritch understanding.  ",
