    "description": "Add the Pathfinder, Woodsman and Shaman to your Talisman: Digital Edition character roster with this pack.\n\nThe Pathfinder is an expert at finding his way around the land of Talisman. Using these skills, he hopes to reach the Crown of Command before any other adventurers. Whether travelling through dangerous crags, dark forests or deadly chasms, the Pathfinder will never set a foot wrong!\n\nThe Woodsman originally appeared in the 2nd Edition of Talisman over 30 years ago. Now, heâ€™s been revised and updated, making his triumphant return to challenge for the Crown of Command. Naturally gifted with axes and at home in the woods, the Woodsman is ready to make his claim for the crown.\n\nThe Shaman is at one with nature and she can transform into a Bear, Cheetah or Owl! In these forms she can increase her strength, her craft or travel further! Using her affinity with nature, the Shaman believes she can claim the Crown of Command for herself.\n\nPurchase this character pack to add these three characters to your character collection. They are then available to choose in all game modes.",
