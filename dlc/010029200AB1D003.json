    "description": "Prison Architect: Going Green brings agriculture to your compound, introducing farming, produce exports, and a whole bunch of contraband.\n\nKey Features\n\nFruits of Labor: Farming introduces a new type of Prison Labor, allowing prisons to grow potatoes, wheat, apples, and more. Produce can be exported or used as ingredients for inmate meals.\n\nRoom to Grow: Three outdoor rooms facilitate farming: Fruit Orchard, Farm Field and Vegetable Allotment. But thatâ€™s not all, players can recruit staff Farm Workers, build a Pantry to store produce, and construct a Shed to house farming-related items.\n\nTrouble is Brewing: With new crops comes new contraband. Prisoners can now secretly grow herbs in the fields and swipe kitchen ingredients to brew Booze. Fields can also become Gang Turf, so keep your guards on alert!\n\nA Greener New Deal: Prisons get an eco-friendly makeover with Solar, Wind, and Solar/Wind Hybrid power sources. Excess power created by these sustainable methods can be sold back to the grid using the Power Export Meter.\n ",
