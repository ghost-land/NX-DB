    "description": "A DLC game mode for DRAGON QUEST MONSTERS: The Dark Prince.\n\nCoach Joe's Dungeon Gym features randomly generated maps that change each time you enter. These magical dungeons also come with restrictions on the monsters you can include in your party, such as those exclusively from the slime family or material family. You are also not allowed to take items with you, and must scavenge the things you need from within the dungeons.\n\nThese dungeons are designed to provide an additional challenge and, as such, are harder than anything you'll encounter in the main game. Fittingly, a boss awaits in the final section of each dungeonâ€”those who defeat it will be rewarded with a valuable item.\n\n(Includes the 'Gothic Vestment' outfit.)\n\n*Content and specifications may be altered without prior warning.",
