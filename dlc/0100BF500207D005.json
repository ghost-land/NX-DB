    "description": "Classic II: Dominique's Curse brings retro-gameplay action to Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night! Defeated by Miriam, Dominique has been cast into Limbo, a realm that does not gladly endure those who have misused demonic powers. Lost and filled with rage, Dominique must fight and survive in this new world. If she can steal Bael’s power, she will return to the land of the living and fulfill her revenge…but only if she can do so before her curse destroys her.\n\nExpanding on the gameplay of the original Classic Mode, Dominique’s Curse features a larger map than its predecessor, an all-new canon Bloodstained storyline and brand-new gameplay!\n\nYour journey will take you to a variety of locales, from deserts and forests to graveyards and beyond. Towns along your route are populated with NPCs and merchants. Sell treasure to upgrade your equipment and purchase health potions. The further you travel, the more powerful the upgrades.  You are going to need them. Speak with the locals to get guidance on your journey...if they can be trusted. These are demons, after all.\n\nBeware the Dead moon! Enemies become stronger when darkness falls and friendly demons quickly become deadly enemies.\n\nIt's a brand new, old-school adventure. Which ending will you get?",
