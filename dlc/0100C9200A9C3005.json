    "description": "Bring chivalry and sorcery to Carcassonne with The Princess & The Dragon!\nWhen a dangerous dragon threatens the land of Carcassonne, everybody goes to the rescue: the followers cry out to the Fairy for help, the Princess gathers her army of knights… Will you face the Dragon, or will you flee through the Magic portals? Find out now!\n\n• Check out the rampaging Dragon Meeple: move it so he can eat up your opponents' Meeples... Unless he eats yours first and ruins all your plans!\n\n• Ask for help from the Fairy Meeple. She will protect you from the Dragon, and even scores you bonus point for your deeds!\n\n• Have fun with new tiles: the Magic portals allowing you to teleport your Meeple across the land.\n\n• As for the Princess, use her wisely to either send one of your opponent’s knights away or to retrieve one of your own to use them again later on. Her favour cost you your ability to place a meeple this turn, however.\n\nIt is possible to combine this expansion with others for an even wilder game!",
