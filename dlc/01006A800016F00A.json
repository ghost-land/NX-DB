    "description": "The legendary Aegis, Pyra, from the Xenoblade Chronicles 2* game comes to the Super Smash Bros.™ Ultimate game. A living weapon known as a Blade, Pyra brings her fiery attacks to the battlefield! This fighter is focused on power and can KO opponents in a flash with her hard-hitting attacks. What makes Pyra truly legendary is her ability to swap with her other, quicker half—Mythra!\n\nMythra Awakens\n\nMythra is a personality locked deep within Pyra—use your down special to let her out! Her light-attuned attacks are similar to Pyra’s but focused on speed rather than power. As Mythra, you can dart across stage hitting enemies with flurries of slashes to build up damage. Then, switch to Pyra to unleash a fiery slash to KO your opponent!\n",
