    "description": "An Apex Predator adds a Carnivore and massive Size, but is unable to attack small Species. AntiSocial Species refuse to join the group and find their own Food where the herd doesn't go. A Carnivore may attack Quills once, but will never make that mistake again.\n\nReady to mix things up at the Watering Hole? Promo Cards are additional traits beyond the base set that introduce new dynamics into Evolution. \nIn a balanced ecosystem, each new Trait impacts all other Traits as well. Explore new strategies to survive against creatures using these mighty traits.\n\nYou can add any combination of these cards to singleplayer games, or make your own deck for Pass & Play and Private games. You can also add one to public multiplayer games, which is then added into the combined deck everyone plays from.",
