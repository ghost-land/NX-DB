    "description": "∑∫ỹriȱŋ is Polytopia’s second Special Tribe! Emerging from isolation in a mystical forest, the ∑∫ỹriȱŋwill stop at nothing to uncover the magical secrets of the Square. The ∑∫ỹriȱŋ are known for surrounding themselves in the magic of the forests, using their powers to lure woodland denizens to their Sanctuaries for profit, bargain with awesome dragons, and enchant animals into soldiers to help them fight.\n\nUnlike the other tribes, the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ have a unique style of gameplay. First, the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ get markers in the Fog of War showing where ruins are, meaning they don’t need to scout as much for them. Also, the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ consider nature divine, and their worship of nature prevents them from deforestation for a quick profit or hunting animals for food. Instead, the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ can build Sanctuaries, which will provide resources based on the amount of adjacent animals. The ∑∫ỹriȱŋ are also unable to harvest whales for resources, and instead will use their magic to transform them into the fearsome Navalon, which can obliterate a navy single handedly! In addition to whales, the Elyrion can enchant animals in their territory into Polytaurs, which can be used to supplement an army or work as part of an early game rush. Lastly, the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ don’t get Giants, but get flying Dragons, instead, which must grow up from an egg before they can be used.\n\nIf you like tribes that are against the grain from what you’re used to, or you simply want to fly on the back of a majestic Fire Dragon, then the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ are the tribe for you!",
