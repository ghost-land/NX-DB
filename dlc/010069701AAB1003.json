    "description": "The original tangrams first appeared in China. These addictive puzzles had players combining triangular pieces (called tans) to form a simple image. All pieces had to be used and could not overlap. It is the elegance of this format that made tangrams a worldwide sensation!\n\nTangrams have come a long way since their global debut, with modern variations introduced beyond the original set of 7 puzzles. Tangram Collection furthers that reinvention, offering welcomed variety to players looking for the next step in tangram evolution.\n\nTangram Collection F features:\n• Over 40 challenging puzzles to keep you solving!\n• Simple and clean interface for that Zen-like puzzling experience.\n\nFounded in 2020, Error300 Games is a game development studio based in Dublin, Ireland. Avid gamers themselves, they strive to make the games they want to play.",
