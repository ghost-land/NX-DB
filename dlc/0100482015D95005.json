    "description": "This expansion contains two additional maps - Ionium and Hellas - and a new team game mode that all add variety and new challenges to the game.\n\nVenus offers players a team variant of classic Concordia for 4 to 6 players divided into teams of two. The team partners win and lose together and are affected by each otherâ€™s actions. \nIonium is a map with two variants - a large 30 City map and a small 22 City map, which introduces a land bridge between the ancient cities of Brundisium and Apollonia; Land Colonists can cross it, but can not stay on that connection. \nHellas is a medium sized map with 25 Cities and 10 Provinces and no additional rules.\n\nPartner-up and re-discover Concordia today!",
