    "description": "What once aided our survival, became the catalyst of our destruction. Dead by Daylight’s End Transmission Chapter features a new Killer – The Singularity – and a new Survivor, Gabriel Soma. A new Map, Toba Landing, is available for all players.  Purchasing this add-on unlocks 2 exclusive Cosmetics: The Singularity’s Curved Scythe and Gabriel’s Illuminated Shirt. \n\nThe Killer is The Singularity. A potential architect of humanity’s extinction, The Singularity is intelligent beyond measure and entirely void of morality. Dead by Daylight: End Transmission also includes a new Survivor – Gabriel Soma. Created from engineered DNA by the Huxlee corporation, the resilient Gabriel emerged as the lone survivor after The Singularity went rogue and slaughtered his entire crew.  ",
