    "description": "This allows you to use a special character and that character's weapon.\n\nAya, the calm and composed swordswoman from the zombie-infested world of \"OneeChanbara,\" has joined the fight, wearing not only her trademark 10-gallon hat and bikini, but also with a katana as her weapon. Usually focused on exterminating zombies, she has decided to break from her normal routine and use her sword-wielding expertise to help save the Earth. She may appear less \"herself\" here compared to her appearance in the \"round\" world, but that's to be expected in a world without curves. For her SP Move, she unleashes her powerful \"Xtasy Combination,\" which feels as good as the name suggests when it hits.",
