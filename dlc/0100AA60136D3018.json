    "description": "At Christmas, it's the thought that counts… so think how awesome it would be to add 3 new cool vehicles to your collection. Wish granted! HOT WHEELS™ - Christmas Pack is our gift for you! \n\nLet's start with Rockin' Santa Sled: the racing version of Santa's sleigh who for once will abandon his reindeers for a few hundred horsepower. With this car he could deliver gifts in half an hour! \n\nAnd then there's Bazoomka™, a small compact jet with a huge front propeller and rear thrusters: it just flew away from an amusement park to land on your tracks. \n\nAnd to top it off, one of the most desired cars by all AcceleRacers fans: Synkro™. With its huge rear wing, exposed engine and its racing set-up, it's really a gifted contender for the championship!\n\nThis DLC includes 3 vehicles: \n- Rockin' Santa Sled\n- Bazoomka™\n- Synkro™",
