With the Legendary Deck for Talisman: Digital Edition, you can increase the challenge to make your adventures even more epic than before. This expansion replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of the base game.\n\nTwo of the strongest creatures have become even more deadly, with a massive increase to their strength or craft. They roam the lands, looking for weak adventurers to terrorise!\n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This can range from creatures being stronger, to allies having less aid to give you.\n\nAll Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
