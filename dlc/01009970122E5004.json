    "description": "Welcome to Gehenna, a brutal frontier planet at the outskirts of space. You've come to the town of Vestige in hopes of collecting a bounty on The Devil Riders, a violent gang of beast-riding mercenaries. Only the scrappiest folks have managed to survive out here - like Rose, a tough-as-nails warrior who's as keen with a katana as a pistol, and Juno, a rugged brawler most locals call The Hatchet.\n \n To take down The Devil Riders, you'll need to learn new tricks to survive Gehenna. Indigenous plants and experiments left behind by a mysterious company open up new approaches to combat and exploration. The new Jetbeast vehicle acts as your trusty steed, a customizable hoverbike. All the while, an enigmatic narrator recounts the details of your rough-and-tumble heroics.\n \n Grab your six-shooter - or whatever fancy guns you Vault Hunters carry these days - and go put those damned Devil Riders in the ground.",
