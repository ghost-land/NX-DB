    "description": "What happens when the body grows but the mind can’t keep up? A child’s fears and anxiety, but trapped inside a full grown man’s body. A furious body wielding a chainsaw? Someone who knows what happens as you disobey your family. What happens if anyone finds out what’s in the stew.\nLeatherface is not only the skin clad maniac with a disturbed mind. He seeks acceptance and appreciation. He’s learned the hard way and was mold to what he now is. A watchdog, a guardian, a blind gate keeper who never questions. And all problems can be solved with his chainsaw.\n\nThis is slaughter in its purest form. A kind of slaughter driven by a pure need of flesh. Leatherface won’t fail and he won’t stop. As the chainsaw starts, you know what is coming. Pain and fear in a combination of panic as you know that death isn’t the end. You will also end up on someone’s plate.",
