    "description": "Each monster race has a signature class that human characters can also select. Except for one, these monsters will be hostile with humans as they attempt to destroy liches in the dungeons! \n\nMonsters can either be played as their signature class, or they can be played as any of the stock classes in Barony. And once you finish the game as a monster, you unlock its signature class for play as any race!\n\nThe Automaton's doesn't need food, instead requiring fuel for their furnace to keep their boiler powered. They're also friendly with humans and some other races!\n\nThe Mechanist showcases the Tinkering skill. By using the Tinkering Kit, survive by building sentries and traps to dispatch foes.\n\nGoblins can't memorize spells, and are unfocused in martial training. But they are resourceful with equipment, making them highly adaptable.\n\nThe Shaman learns unique spells as they level up, which allows them to shapechange into monster forms with versatile abilities and advantages.\n\nThe Incubus hates blessings and loves curses! He'll also start with some demonic powers.\n\nWith spells to abuse and confuse victims, the Punisher also frustrates foes with the whip, just out of reach.\n\nInsectoids will eat anything, and they love sugar. They use Energy from food to power their spells instead of MP. Their wings also give them extra mobility powers!\n\nStarting with a magic boomerang, and new quivers full of special ammunition, hunters are adept at tracking and killing enemies from a distance.",
