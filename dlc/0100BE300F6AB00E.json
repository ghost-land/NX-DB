    "description": "Want to add some challenge to your next Talisman: Digital Edition adventure? With the Legendary Deck for The Highland Expansion, you can increase the difficulty of cards you’ll encounter when playing with this expansion.\n\nThis Legendary Deck replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of the Highland Expansion, with the new cards being designed to offer extra challenge for hardcore Talisman players. It also increases the difficulty of battling the Eagle King.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the Highland Expansion in order to use this Legendary Deck.\n\nWhat is in the legendary deck?\n\nAfter having been betrayed by the Great Wizard, the Eagle King has been waiting for his chance to destroy the Crown of Command. With his newly reinforced powers, he’s ready to strike down any adventurers in his path!\n\nGaining favour from the Eagle King himself, two of the most fearsome monsters to stalk the Highland have been made even more ferocious. They wait in hiding, ready to easily destroy unwary adventurers.\n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This includes cards providing less support than they originally would, making your journey through the Highlands even more treacherous.\n\nAll Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
