    "description": "Led by Signy, the Spear Maiden, the cunning members of the clan have little regard for fame or honour and would rather use guerilla tactics to dominate their enemies than open warfare.\n\nThe clan’s warchief is available at the beginning of the game and, while her martial skills are slightly better than a Warrior’s at first, she will grow as seasons go by, becoming more powerful and unlocking new abilities in the process. Her most powerful skill, “Scorched Earth”, can only be unlocked once Signy becomes an adult, and will allow her to burn down a tile, providing attack bonuses to her units and buildings.",
