It will fight to dominate the universe... and every race too! \n\nEmbodying the abilities of a skilled sorcerer, Skeletor™ will take you straight to the finish line like magic, teleporting you to the highest step of the podium. Finally, thanks to your help, it will be able to defeat even the hated He-Man™!
