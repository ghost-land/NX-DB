    "description": "The home of Kindred's brand new proposed resort 'Boomerdale' has been reporting a spike it atmospheric pollutants. They want you to get in there and figure out why. You'll gather some fresh upgrades, and be introduced to the second best interstellar space exploration company... But why are they there? And what do you need to do to get rid of them? This expansion pack features new abilities to gather and craft that you can take back to the main game, plus, perhaps the power of flight!! (Which you cannot take back to the main game but whatever... it's fun while it lasts!)",
