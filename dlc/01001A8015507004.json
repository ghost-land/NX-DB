    "description": "You can now play “Kobayakawa” in “Let’s Play! Oink Games”\n\nWhen playing with friends, as long as 1 person owns the game, the other players do not need to own it to play.\n\n● Kobayakawa\nKobayakawa is a simple, casino-style gambling card game.\nAfter you play your turn, bet your coins and try to predict whether or not the last card in your hand has the biggest number among all of the players.\nHowever, watch out for the tricky \"Kobayakawa\" card. This card is added to the lowest card's value, so even if you're holding the biggest number, a win is not guaranteed. Full of bluffing and bravery, this is a game exploding with excitement.\n\n- Supported Players: Offline 1 Player, Online/Local 1-8 Players (Playable with CPU opponents)",
