    "description": "High up in a seemingly abandoned skyscraper, on an empty floor without entrance there stands a single large closet. In that closet hangs a contraption, something from a time Toxic would rather not think about. Using the data she had found on Latch, she delved into questionable arts and created an ivory automaton. As a product of her mindstate at the time it turned erratic and hostile. Now it's sealed away, set to activate if Toxic would ever be captured by the Shine City Police.\n\n- The Ivory Puppet: Killer colorway. It's got a blade for each digit.\n- The Ivory Puppet: Mourner colorway. A sickening black, red and green tinted look.",
