    "description": "Hellraiser is a new Chapter in Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, Pinhead. Purchasing the add-on unlocks both the new Killer and an exclusive universal charm: The Lament Configuration.  \n \nDemon to some, angel to others, the new Killer is Pinhead: leader of an extra-dimensional group of beings known as the Cenobites. Devoted to exploring the furthest regions of experience through the limitless thrill of pleasure and pain, Pinhead uses hooks and chains to attack his victims, tearing their flesh, and souls, apart in the process. When the puzzle box known as the Lament Configuration – a key to Pinhead’s dimension – was discovered and opened in The Entity’s Realm, he arrived, ready to bestow sweet suffering upon any who crossed his path.
