    "description": "It’s time for some camping capers as you take a trek through the forests of the Onion Kingdom. Joining Kevin and the Onion King are 4 new chefs that are right at home in the woodland kitchens; Scout Chef, Bear Chef, Beaver Chef and the bespectacled Owl Chef.\n\nYou’ll need to chop wood to keep the fires burning as you fry up a hearty breakfast, or toast tasty S’mores across 15 new levels set amongst tree-tops and campsites. Fresh levels of co-operation will be needed for the new wearable backpacks that hold the ingredients the team of chefs need to serve the hungry campers.",
