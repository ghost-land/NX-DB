    "description": "The Saw® Chapter is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight and it includes a new Killer, a Survivor and a Map.\n\nLife is the most precious thing we have. A gift we are given, but a gift some squander. We need to be alive and not just exist. This is where The Pig steps in - a teacher that provides those selected with an opportunity to appreciate life yet again. To fight for our own survival, or simply let go and die. David Tapp thinks otherwise. He believes that everyone is free to live their own life, without the threat of death in the shape of a trap. A seasoned detective that seeks The Pig - a search that brings him to the Gideon Meat Plant.",
