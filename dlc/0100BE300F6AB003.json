    "description": "Explore a new region, battle new foes and meet the grim reaper when you add these 3 expansions to your Talisman collection.\n\nExplore the new woodland region in The Woodland expansion, delving deep into dark forests. Discover your destiny with new Path and Destiny cards, giving you permanent bonuses if you can walk the correct path. Also introduced in the Woodland is light and dark fate, allowing you to use your fate to affect other players, not just yourself!\n\nThe world of Talisman is set aflame in The Fireland expansion! The Ifrit who forged the Crown have returned, and bring with them new adventure cards and fireland tokens. Burned cards are removed from the game completely, and fireland tokens will set spaces alight, burning any player who ends their turn there.\n\nThe Reaper expansion adds a deadly new NPC to Talisman, as death himself wanders the land. If an adventurer encounters the Grim Reaper, they must roll a dice to see if they gain his favour or his wrath! Also included in this expansion are new adventure, spell and quest cards to make your adventures even more exciting.\n\nEach expansion included in this pack comes with new characters to play, new adventure cards and new creatures to encounter. Each expansion can also be enabled or disabled individually, depending on how you want to play!",
