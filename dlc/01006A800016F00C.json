    "description": "Sora from the KINGDOM HEARTS  series joins the Super Smash Bros. Ultimate roster! Wielding his Keyblade and an arsenal of spells, Sora is a veteran when it comes to battling enemies and is ready to bring his 3-hit combos and aerial style into the fray. The new Hollow Bastion stage, based on one of the most iconic locations in the series, gives you a grand tour of a whimsically sinister castle. As the battle nears its close, you’ll travel to a special area inspired by Dive to the Heart with visuals featuring some familiar faces from the KINGDOM HEARTS series.\n\nSora’s fighting style in the KINGDOM HEARTS games has been faithfully adapted to his appearance in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. His standard special cycles between three powerful elemental spells—Firaga, Thundaga, and Blizzaga. His other special attacks like Sonic Blade and Aerial Sweep will help you navigate the skies and keep opponents on their toes. Sora’s Final Smash, Sealing the Keyhole, will shut the door on your enemies and lock them away to oblivion!\n",
