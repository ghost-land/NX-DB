    "description": "Two cars that left their mark on an era in a booster pack. The Lancia 037 was a legendary Group B car in the 1980s. It was the last rear-wheel drive to win the World Rally Championship. With a 4-cylinder 205hp engine, it offers a unique driving experience and is difficult to tame. As for the Porsche 911 GT3 RS RGT, it is a monster of power and technology. Thanks to its flat-six 500hp engine and unmistakable sound, there are no other cars quite like it.\n",
