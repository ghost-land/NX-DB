    "description": "Heroes used to come riding a horse. And now, they come riding a beast with over 700 horsepower. But the result is the same: complete triumph! \n\nMcLaren 720S is a car with absolutely stunning lines, born to move seamlessly through the air (and through the finish line) with style and power. Probably it can fly so well on the track because of its butterfly doors... or maybe thanks to its super V8 engine… For sure, this beauty is really a beast! Its design is a jewel that cannot be missing in your collection!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 3",
