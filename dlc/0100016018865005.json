But you won't be alone: an angel of Sarenrae with a tragic past and a captivating new android companion will join you as you confront the evil flourishing in the remote corners of Golarion. And don’t think your commander is being left out — a new quest and dungeon will be available to complete in the fifth chapter of the base game.\n\nContinue your journey with a character from Through the Ashes DLC or create a new one: 15 new archetypes, new spells and new feats await you. All of these will also be available in the main campaign when creating a new character or retraining one.\n",
