    "description": "Skin Pack #1 includes the following skins: \n- Bardur Baergøff\n- Hoodrick Yorthwober\n- Vengir Cultist\n\nBardur Baergøff\nBardur who have survived the 5 Tests of Strength are given the rank of Baergøff, meaning “Elite Baerion Hunter”. The sanctified Baerion pelt is thought to let the wearer channel the animal's raw ferocity in battle.\n\nHoodrick Yorthwober\nCan you hit a BuzzFly with an arrow from 2 tiles away? Then you might be ready for the Hoodrick Yorthwober. These expert sharpshooters have been personally trained in combat and survival by Yorth, the legendary archer, and comprise the most elite force the Hoodrick can muster.\n\nVengir Cultists\nVengir of the fanatical Burzgor Cult will perform the visceral Thdkrkr Ritual, shrugging off their mortal flesh and gaining power directly from the God of Blood, themself. Their zealous display of devotion isn’t taken as seriously as they’d like by the other tribes, however.",
