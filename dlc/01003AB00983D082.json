    "description": "After one of his many rampages Doombox woke up chained up in a brightly lit laboratory. Pretending to be in stand-by mode, he overheard the heated discussions of his captors. \"It's still subject A1, it just fused with a boombox somehow. The energy signal is not unique, that's why you destroyed that lab in South Shine City instead\". \"We had to use the cannon!! There was no other way!\". Doombox couldn't care less about them. He blasted his chains off and shattered all the glass in the room. A half-liquid entity dripped down on him from a canister labelled B1. That was the last thing he remembered.\n\n- The Gigahertz Visualizer X colorway. A red/black fit with visualizer arms.\n- The Gigahertz Visualizer Z colorway. A purple/magenta fit with visualizer arms.",
