    "description": "The DEMISE OF THE FAITHFUL is a Chapter for Dead by Daylight. It includes a new Killer, a Survivor, a Map, and an exclusive item for the new Survivor.\n\nSurrender yourself to the vast inexplicable: that is the oath of the faithful. In darkness, they look inward for a beacon of light. But when their light is distorted by pride and ambition, how long will they err in the dark? \n \nThe Plague found solace in sacred rituals, a way to repel the darkness she carried inside. As a High Priestess of Babylon, she believed she was invulnerable. When a sickness began to defile her body, she confronted her gods, realizing too late they were not the ones answering her prayers. \n \nJane Romero was striving to become a TV host, an inspiring voice for those in need. Every day she would share her beliefs and practices with thousands of followers. One evening, driving home after a particularly stressful live show, she closed her eyes for a momentâ€¦ and never made it home.\n",
