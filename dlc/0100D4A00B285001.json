    "description": "Use skills honed on ARK's faraway Island to kill, tame, breed, and ride the fantastical new creatures that have evolved to survive the Desert's ultra harsh conditions, including... DRAGONS! Travel back and forth between the Island and the Desert to team up with hundreds of players across both worlds or play locally!\n\nEXPLORE A NEW WORLD\nScorched Earth takes ARK players to an entirely new land, composed of six unique, desert themed biomes – dunes, high desert, mountains, canyons, badlands and oasis – each with their own aesthetic and ecosystem. Littered with ruins, geysers, and intricate ancient cave systems, survivors will find a whole new frontier to explore and master.\n\nTAME NEW CREATURES\nThe biomes of Scorched Earth are filled with dangerous new creatures, and the intrepid survivor will find that many of them can be tamed. Among others, lead a caravan of the camel-like Morellatops, or rain fire down upon your enemies from the back of an elemental Wyvern. Just mind your step, or you might attract a Death Worm!\n\nCRAFT OVER 50 NEW ITEMS\nUsing what resources they can scrounge together, survivors can craft distinct new outfits and structures to beat the heat, and new tools to help them survive in this desolate environment. Players can use whips, boomerangs, flamethrowers, chainsaws, and much more to defend themselves, or such things as tents, wells, wind turbines, and oil refineries to provide their bases with resources. When used creatively, these tools can open up whole new strategies for survival, self defense or epic tribal warfare.\n\nCONQUER NEW CHALLENGES\nPrepare yourself for dangerous electrical storms, blinding sand storms, befuddling heat stroke, and unleash the power of the mysterious Obelisks to come face-to-face with the ARK’s deadliest boss creature to date – the ferocious Manticore! Does it protect a powerful weapon, a precious relic, or the mysteries of the ARK itself? Only survivors who posses the courage to confront this fearsome beast will learn the truth.\n\nTRAVEL BETWEEN ARKS\nSurvivors can take their character, favorite creatures and items between the Island and the new Desert ARKs, making their Island-dwelling friends jealous with all of the amazing new items, structures, creatures and secrets they find in the Desert.\n\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\n\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!",
