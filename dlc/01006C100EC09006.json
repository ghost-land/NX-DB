A shard from the Orb of Dominance carried on a dark current now awakens creatures that have long slumbered beneath the waves. It's up to you to free the tides from the undertow of corruption. Legions of sunken and drowned enemies lurk among the lost treasures, so you must remain vigilant under pressure. The ocean's natural beauty can distract from the dangers of the deep, but new weapons, gear, and artifacts will make everything go swimmingly.\n\n- Three new underwater missions\n- A mix of salty new mobs and enemies\n- New weapons, gear, and artifacts \n- Two new skins and a baby turtle pet",
