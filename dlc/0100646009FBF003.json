    "description": "Try not to fall as you wind your way along the sheer cliffs of the island’s coast. Explore floating shrines, infiltrate the lair of an outlawed secret society and learn the tells of a new boss. This is new mid game content for people looking for alternatives to the Stilt Village, Clock Tower and Time Keeper areas and their parallels.\n\nThe Fractured Shrines: Breathtaking views, kamikaze crows, spear-wielding snakes, sadistic new traps and an endless fall if you slip. What more could you ask for?\n\nThe Undying Shores: Not the beach you had in mind for your time off… Creepy lantern wielding wizards and their shovel brandishing minions. Not at all the holiday you planned...\n\nThe Mausoleum: A new humanoid boss with his own story to tell, tough pattern based combat and a magnificent setting for a showdown. \n\nOn top of the new areas, enemies and pet sword, you’ll of course need new tools for killing and what we’ve provided here should be particularly effective.",
