He bears the Dragonscar on his chest.\n\nHis contract with Atruum imbued his chest with the dragon's power, strengthening his body and giving him excellent defense.\n\nBy concentrating power into the Dragon Body, he can deploy an impregnable shield that protects nearby allies from harm and heals them over time.\n\nHe can also enter a berserk state, which enables him to use devastating new attacks and increases his attack power, but drastically lowers his defense.
