    "description": "This DLC includes two new dinosaurs to hunt immediately. Advanced hunting skills are absolutely required if your goal is to add them to your trophy room.\nThe Giganotosaurus (“giant southern lizard”) was one of the largest carnivorous dinosaurs to ever exist on Earth. With a keen sense of smell,  Giganotosaurus (a therapod dinosaur) is faster than an adult Tyrannosaurus Rex, but its brain is just half the size of its famous relative. The Giganotosaurus tends to prowl in circular patterns near lakes, but it can certainly (and occasionally will!) roam the entire island, so remain alert at all times! When this monster isn’t snacking on unlucky human hunters, its usual diet consists of juvenile sauropod dinosaurs.\nThe Carnotaurus (“meat-eating bull”) is the only carnivore with two characteristic horns that sprout immediately above its eyes, and its uniquely muscular neck distinguishes this pugnacious predator from its meat-eating counterparts. \nSmaller than Tyrannosaurus Rex and built for speed (up to 35 mph/ 56kmph!) and pure power, Carnotaurus (a theropod dinosaur) is more agile and faster than T. Rex, and it always hunts near water within and around the island. It is an incredibly effective killing machine, so take no chances when you’re out there!",
