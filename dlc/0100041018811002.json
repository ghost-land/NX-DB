    "description": "The most successful car in WRC history. With 3 manufacturers' titles and 4 drivers' titles within a four-year period, it experienced little else except success, thanks to the legendary driver Sébastien Loeb.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2010, the Citroën C4 WRC won 36 out of the 56 WRC rallies it took part in. Utterly dominant during this period, Sébastien Loeb won 34 times for Citroën with the C4, and it was this same car that gave Sébastien Ogier, Loeb's successor, his first two WRC rally wins in 2010.\nWith an unusual design for the era but extraordinary performance, this car was one of the most popular WRC rally cars.\n",
