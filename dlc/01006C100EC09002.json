    "description": "\"A creeping winter is slowly taking over everything it touches, and the source of its chilling power\nis a powerful creature known as the Wretched Wraith. To stop the never-ending winter in its icy\ntracks, a noble hero must take on new missions in the lands trapped below zero. It won’t just be\nwintry winds that seek to throw the hero from their path to destroy the Wretched Wraith, but new\nenemies such as the Illusioner and Iceologer will join the brawl! As you hunt down the source of\ncorruption, you’ll discover new armour, weapons, and artifacts below the snow and sleet. Stay\ncool and keep a steady hand, for the frost is unforgiving.\"\n",
