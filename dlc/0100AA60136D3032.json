    "description": "Racing is known to be full of ups and downs, but we are taking things too far now! Someone had the brilliant idea of building skyscrapers right in the middle of the track... and you will see them getting taller by the second! It will take your best reflexes to make your way through these towers that will suddenly rise blocking your way. \n\nNine buildings in constant motion that you’ll need to avoid or exploit to your advantage, thanks to special passages and jumps created inside them. You'll need a fail-proof plan to get past the most dangerous neighborhood in the race. Add the Jumping Towers module to your track and take home victory!\n\nThis DLC is included in the HOT WHEELS™ Pass Vol. 3",
