    "description": "Want to add some challenge to your next Talisman: Digital Edition adventure? With this Legendary Deck, you can increase the difficulty of cards you’ll encounter from The Sacred Pool Expansion. This expansion replaces selected cards from the adventure deck of the Sacred Pool Expansion, redesigned to offer extra challenge for hardcore Talisman players.\n\nPlease note: You need to have the original Sacred Pool Expansion in order to use this Legendary Deck.\n\nThe cards in the Sacred Pool have had an overhaul, making them deadlier to any adventurer unlucky enough to stumble across them.\n\nA Champion has risen up for both the forces of light and darkness. Make sure you’re on the right side when you encounter these creatures, otherwise you’ll be sure to meet your end.\n\nBy playing with this Legendary Deck enabled, your adventure cards will be replaced with new, more challenging cards. This includes cards providing less support, making the battle between light and dark even more treacherous. All Legendary Deck cards also come with a shiny new look, to help you spot them as you play.\n\nPurchasing this Legendary Deck adds it to your Talisman: Digital Edition collection. It is then available to choose in all game modes.",
