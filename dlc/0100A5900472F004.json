The location is inspired by the academies that produce so many great players and host elite tournaments.\n\nFollow in the footsteps of the Russian Grandmasters that played in the halls of the academy and immerse yourself in Chess Ultra. \n\nThis pack contains a chess set & an environment. These can be used separately and paired with all other sets and environments in game.",
