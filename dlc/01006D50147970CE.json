    "description": "In the world of \"Earth Defense Force: Iron Rain,\" the Kindred Rebellion ceded from the EDF and developed their own experimental Prowl Rider PA-Gear. While the EDF's Prowl Rider technology took the lead and the Rebellion's version of the gear came to be known as a \"prototype,\" its specs are comparable to the EDF's official gear. This allows you to use the Kindred Rebellion's version of the Prowl Rider, equipped with a special weapon. Now, go and prove that the Rebellion's technology is a force to be reckoned with.",
