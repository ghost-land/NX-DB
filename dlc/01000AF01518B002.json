    "description": "Two new factions and Vagabond variants bring new challenges to Root! \n\nRiverfolk Company\nThe Riverfolk Company is open for business â€“ the woodland may be at war, but there's no reason you can't make a profit! Establish trade posts and earn your victory! \n\nLizard Cult\nSpread the scaly gospel of the Lizard Cult! Tend your gardens to radicalize new acolytes, and reveal the true extent of your proselytizing power! \n\nNew Vagabond Variants!\nThree new Vagabonds skulk into the woodland to help you swindle your way to victory! The Scoundrel torches the woodland rather than see others rule it; the Vagrant starts fights that others have to finish; and the Arbiter offers their services...for a price, of course! \n\nNew Challenges!\nNew single-player scenarios and tutorials help you learn the wily ways of the latest woodland warriors!",
