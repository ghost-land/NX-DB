    "description": "There are two new areas to explore in the Galar region, and The Isle of Armor is the first area included in the Pokémon Shield™ Expansion Pass. This island is full of beautiful landscapes—beaches, bogs, forests, and more—that can be explored seamlessly like the Wild Area. And of course, you’ll find Pokémon that you couldn’t previously find in Galar dwelling there, too! In this story focused on growth, you’ll study under a former Champion, Mustard, and train alongside the new Legendary Pokémon Kubfu. What Pokémon, people, and challenges will you find on the Isle of Armor? \n\nThe fighting-type Kubfu you receive from Mustard can fight by your side and even evolve into one of two forms. Not only can this newly discovered Pokémon Gigantamax—the Rillaboom, Cinderace, or Inteleon in your party will also be able to Gigantamax! You’ll need the extra power when battling Avery, a psychic-type Trainer also studying under Mustard’s tutelage. You can discover these new people, places, Pokémon, and more on The Isle of Armor! Keep the adventure going with your existing Pokémon Shield save data and jump into this new expansion to Pokémon Shield! Your Galar adventure just got even bigger!",
