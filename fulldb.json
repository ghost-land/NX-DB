The goal is\nto climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to break through\nthe canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same time throughout\nthe game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark forest.\nMankind has been driven from their homes among the trees by the Night King, a\nnightmarish beast whose origin has been lost to time. Now, man lives in the\ndirt, fearing the moments the Night King leaves his roost to prey upon their\nvulnerable forms. \nEvery generation the elders send a young couple out into the world to find a new\nhome for their people where they need not fear the relentless hunger of the\nNight King. Every generation these journeys have failed. This time however, the\nyoung couple has decided to ascend into the trees and reclaim their ancestral\nhome instead of fleeing into the darkness. Can they rise above?\nControlling 2 Characters with 1 GamePad\nIn Above: The Fallen, you play as both the male and female characters at the\nsame time (Single Player Mode Only). They often find themselves in situations\nthat require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the\ncanopy. Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers\nan additional challenge and requires you to think about each character's\npositioning before moving. If you don't get the hang of it right away, don't\nworry, it won't be long before you're climbing through the jungle like Tarzan.\nSingle Player or Co-op mode!\nBring a friend along with you as you adventure through the world, solve puzzles\nand work together to defeat the Night King. Swap back and forth easily from\nsingle player to co-op with a push of a button.Vertical Scrolling / Climbing\nClimbing is essential to the goal of reaching the forest's canopy. This differs\nfrom traditional side-scrollers where you generally move in a straight line\nthroughout the world.Puzzles\nThere are many interesting puzzles that you'll come across as you play. Some\npuzzles are solvable in multiple ways which allows for some freedom to explore.\nEach successfully completed puzzle brings you closer to facing the Night King!\nSkills\nAs you progress through the world you'll come across shrines that when\nactivated, interact with your amulet, and unlock ancient magic hidden away from\nhumanity. The character's will then receive a new skill which will be needed to\ncomplete upcoming puzzles.Enemies\nThere are many animals to watch out for while exploring the forest. Use caution\nwhile approaching them though, they don't like being disturbed."

A spin-off of the Sonic the Hedgehog series, the game\nfeatures Knuckles the Echidna and four other characters known as the Chaotix.\nThe story follows the team in their efforts to prevent Doctor Robotnik and Metal\nSonic from obtaining six magic rings and conquering a mysterious island.\nGameplay is similar to earlier Sonic games: players complete levels while\ncollecting rings and defeating enemies. Knuckles' Chaotix introduces a partner\nsystem whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether. This\ntether behaves like a rubber band and must be handled appropriately to maneuver\nthe characters through the stages.\nUnlike many other Sonic games, Knuckles' Chaotix was not developed by Sonic\nTeam, but another internal development team at Sega. Development can be traced\nback to Sonic Crackers, a 1994 prototype for the Sega Genesis which experimented\nwith the tethering mechanics and featured Sonic and Tails. The concept was\nretained when development transitioned to the 32X under the working title\nKnuckles' Ringstar. Sonic and Tails were removed from the game and replaced by\nKnuckles and four other characters, including Mighty the Armadillo, who first\nappeared in the arcade game SegaSonic the Hedgehog (1993).\nCritical reception to Knuckles' Chaotix has been mixed. Critics found the\ntethering physics cumbersome, although some appreciated it as an attempt by Sega\nto innovate in the series. It is seen as the last in the \\\"classic\\\" 2D style of\nSonic games before the series moved to 3D. Some characters and concepts\nintroduced in the game were featured in later Sonic games and media. Despite\ninterest from fans, it has not been re-released beyond a brief period through\nGameTap in the mid-2000s."

Despite its original\nentry garnering large attraction out of region, this edition of Joker 2 was only\nmade available in Japan on 31st March, 2011. On the bright side,\nfan-translations have been made to account for this.\nThe revamped version of the game shares the same storyline of its initial entry,\nalthough it does stray with adding extra sequences. In addition to that,\nthere&#39;s a few visual changes players of the original may notice, such as the\nprotagonist&#39;s clothing changing from red to blue. There are new maps to\nexplore, with more items to collect and craft.\nAs a call back to previous titles of the Dragon Quest series, and as a bonus\nincentive to pick up the game, the game also includes 100 new monsters to find\nand synthesize. Most of which come from the recent &#39;Dragon Quest IX&#39; and\n&#39;Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime&#39; titles at the time. To go in par\nwith that, there&#39;s a new &quot;final-final&quot; boss for players to seek\nout- which can prove a challenging opponent compared to other bosses before it!"

All of this leads to the implementation of\nthe Divine Education Act.\nNow, a year has passed and numerous goddesses and humans have had the chance to\nlearn about each other, get to know one another, and come to a mutual\nunderstanding.\nIn Akihabara, the very heart of the Divine Idol culture and home to various\nsubcultures, seven lucky goddesses dominate as the idol group L\u2606SEVEN.\nNext-Generation Goddess Auditions!\nDivine Idols, spread your wings and take flight!\nA glamorous contest, containing everything that goddess\u2019 dreams are made of, is\nbeing held!\nLaugh, grow, and even cry together with goddesses who descended from the sky and\nare aiming to become top-level idols.\nThe younger sister of Bishamonten, who is a member of the top idol group\ncomprised of the seven lucky goddesses, L\u2606SEVEN.\nShuri has always looked up to her older sister, performing on the streets with\nthe aim to become an idol as well.\nBubbly and while seemingly full of confidence, there are times when she ends up\ncomparing herself to her more-successful sister and doesn\u2019t give herself enough\ncredit. She\u2019s down-to-earth and usually hardworking, but can quickly lose\ninterest in things and isn\u2019t afraid to show it.\nKisshouten represents prosperity and good luck, along with happiness, beauty,\nand wealth. She is worshipped in hopes of gaining respect and sometimes in the\nhope for bountiful harvests.\nAme no Uzume is a deity found originally in Shinto mythology. She appears in\nsome of the oldest legends, such as the tale of the missing sun deity, when\nAmaterasu Omikami hid herself away at Amano-Iwato. She's said to be Japan's\noldest performance artist.\nShe works part-time in a Divine Idol-themed cafe while building up her career\nfrom the grassroots level.\nKagura likes to have fun, but that doesn't mean she's a slacker. Her unique\nsense of rhythm and expressionism when she dances are both hers alone; no one\nelse can duplicate them.\nIn true \u2018Ame no Uzume\u2019 spirit, she usually ends up giving the audience a little\nmore of a risque performance as she easily gets worked up. But there are also\ntimes when she relaxes and can stay calm. Her personality is carefree and\nplayful, which easily comes across in how she interacts with others.\nAs one of the more naturally seductive goddesses, she is not opposed to wearing\nmore revealing costumes when she performs.\nBenzaiten's blessings are plentiful; she is the goddess of music, good fortune,\nthe arts, victory, and even water. She holds the center position in L\u2606SEVEN.\nShe loves singing, but since she hasn't fallen in love yet, and with the\nabundance of love songs in the idol music genre, she often becomes doubtful of\nher ability to sing love songs convincingly.\nShe tends to play acoustic guitar when singing casually.\nEven though she's always at the center, at heart she's just a regular girl.\nShe can always be found smiling, which matches her cheerful personality.\nHer manner of speaking is calm and collected, but she sometimes lets her playful\nside show during conversations.\nJapanese Animated Novel / Visual Novel HD\nThree character routes to play through \nFully Voiced characters (only the protagonist isn't voiced)\nAnimated Sprites"

An early example of the platform game genre, the gameplay\nfocuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while\ndodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, Mario (originally named Mr.\nVideo and then Jumpman) must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline\n(originally named Lady), from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape\nlater became two of Nintendo&#39;s most popular and recognizable characters.\nDonkey Kong is one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade\nvideo games, and is one of the most popular arcade games of all time.\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the\nNorth American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo&#39;s president at the time,\nassigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto.\nDrawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the\nBeast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game\nalongside Nintendo&#39;s chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new\nground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to\nadvance the game&#39;s plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\nDespite initial doubts by Nintendo&#39;s American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded\ncommercially and critically in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the\ngame to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms.\nOther companies cloned Nintendo&#39;s hit and avoided royalties altogether.\nMiyamoto&#39;s characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and\ndozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging\nDonkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The\nsuccess of Donkey Kong and Nintendo&#39;s victory in the courtroom helped to\nposition the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981\nuntil the late 1990s (1996\u20131999)."

A sole\nsurviving castle guard journeys with the king, the princess, a reformed bandit\nnamed Yangus and a few other companions in search of the evil jester and a way\nto break the curse.\nDragon Quest VIII: Journey of the Cursed King is a traditional Japanese-style\nrole-playing game with random enemy encounters, simple turn-based combat\nmechanics, and management of a party consisting of four characters, each\nbelonging to a clearly defined class. Unlike its predecessors in the series and\nmost Japanese RPGs in general, the game features a continuous world with fairly\nvast landscapes and integrated towns and dungeons, as opposed to world map\ntraveling and locations represented by icons. The game features full camera\nrotation and optional first-person view. Like in the previous Dragon Quest\ngames, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be\nphysically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.\nIn addition to experience points, the player receives skill points from battles,\nwhich can be manually allocated into a skill category of the player&#39;s\nchoice. These categories include three different kinds of weapons, fisticuffs,\nand a discipline unique to each character. After a required amount of skill\npoints has been invested into a particular category, the correspondent character\nlearns a new ability or becomes more proficient with the chosen weapon. The\nAlchemy Pot system allows players to gather recipes and mix items to create new\nones.\nThe international version of the game features several updates to the original\nJapanese version, including voice acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks,\nand flashier effects."

            "description": "You finally left home on August 9th, 2017. You hated that place, you hated how\nit made you feel... And yet you closed yourself off in that unfortunate abode.\nLeaving was the only rational choice, but maybe it wasn't the best one. Even\nonce you leave, scars don't simply disappear. They say time heals all wounds,\nbut the extent of how much that can heal may be limited. Especially when it\nkeeps being picked and torn at, when you're expected to do something, something\nyou hate. But it lingers over you, tortures you.\nI hope you love this game, I mean that sincerely. Would you please love this\ncomputer game? In the game you explore a black and white house; you can just\nwander, and indeed may wander for some time without really knowing what to do.\nBut I promise you that there is depth and hidden layers here. Sometimes we want\nto be loved, but not want to be seen. But how can one expect to truly be loved\nif one also won't share oneself? Loving anything else but the true person is\nlike loving an apparition, it's just an image of a being rather than the being\nthemselves.\nIt's a sort of cryptic house exploration game about discovery, road blocks,\natmosphere, love, and creation. There are things to interact with, non-linear\nprogression, and various tough obstacles. The game may close at times, but\nthat's not the end. It's all pretty ambiguous and not really made to be played\nwith a single person trying to figure out what to do, more with a group or a\ncommunity. I give this heed as there's a very high chance you make get stuck in\na rut without much of a clue how to get further. This is natural, the game is\nquite cryptic and there's layers of discovery of how to make progress.\nTo understand the depths of love is to understand the depths of being. This game\nincludes puzzles and atmospheric elements. In many ways it's a game that can be\nsolved, but doesn't want to be. You could consider that a puzzle game, but it's\nnot really about the puzzles. They're more like a defense mechanism, a shell to\nbreak through. It only takes one person to change one's life, but for better\ninsight we often need a viewpoint outside the ourselves that two people create.\nI doubt any one person will be able to beat this game alone, it might take some\nconjuncture and cooperation. But that maybe shouldn't be surprising... How can\none truly understand love if one doesn't let others in? Different people and\nexperiences help us understand different things, and it's in that fragile act of\nsharing that we can open ourselves to new discoveries.\nThe game is cryptic and creepy, but can you still love it? Can you explore the\ndepths and still see its good qualities? Can you even find the depths? I guess\nin a word this game is about discovery. If you like to discover things, then you\nmay like this game. There's a lot to discover, and a lot of it isn't obvious.\nBut despite not being easy or simple, I hope you will still come to love this\ncomputer game. Through all of it's roughness and unfriendly design, you can love\nthe tender core.\nFor if you can love it, then maybe...."

The game was released in Japan in 2005, and\nin North America and Europe the following year. Originally conceived as a\npoint-and-click adventure game, it was put on developmental hold until Nintendo\nproducer Shigeru Miyamoto gained interest in the title and overhauled its\nproduction.\nThe player takes on the role of the eponymous character, Chibi-Robo, a\n10-centimeter-tall robot owned by the Sanderson family. Gameplay revolves around\nnavigating a household and collecting &quot;Happy Points&quot;. These points are\naccumulated by completing various tasks from housework to helping solve the\ndilemmas of the Sanderson family and the numerous living toys that inhabit their\nhousehold. Every action by the game&#39;s battery-powered protagonist consumes\nenergy, requiring the player to recharge using the home&#39;s electrical\noutlets.\nChibi-Robo! was generally well received by critics, with praise directed towards\nthe premise, charming storyline, and sound design. However, some gameplay\nmechanics and the quality of the graphics drew some criticism. Sales of\nChibi-Robo! were modest. It spawned several sequels. For the Nintendo DS,\nChibi-Robo!: Park Patrol was released in 2007 and Okaeri! Chibi-Robo! Happy\nRichie \u014cs\u014dji! was released in 2009, the latter being a Japan-exclusive. For the\nNintendo 3DS, Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder was released in Japan in 2013 and in\nNorth America in 2014, and Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash was released in 2015. The\noriginal Chibi-Robo! also saw a Japanese re-release in 2009 for the Wii as part\nof the New Play Control! series."

New\nfootie stars, new moves and a whole new adventure\u2019s kicking off in Inazuma\nEleven GO: Light and Inazuma Eleven GO: Shadow on Nintendo 3DS family systems!\nTen years after Inazuma Eleven 3, newbie Arion Sherwind is putting on his Raimon\nHigh soccer kit. It\u2019s his first day, and he\u2019s revved up to be joining the\nschool\u2019s famous football club. But after a weird kid appears on the pitch, Arion\nworks out the club is going to be closed down by a shady company called Fifth\nSector, the big bosses in charge of youth football. Time to lace up!\nBefore you even think about going near a ball, you\u2019ve got to make a choice\nbetween two editions, Light and Shadow. The core content is the same, but there\nare unique characters, techniques and teams (among other things) to each. Which\none will you choose?\nAfter you join the school football club, you\u2019ll need to recruit a team \u2013 and a\n\u2018good\u2019 one won\u2019t be enough. There are two ways to shape your squad: first, you\ncould thrash another team in a five-a-side Battle, and get a request to join\nfrom an opposition player. You could also buy some PalPack Cards from dealers.\nThink of them as brochures for new players, complete with stats and sign-up\nrequirements. As you play more and more, you can potentially meet over a\nthousand players, but you only get 16 slots for your team, and just 110 for the\nentire roster, so pick carefully!\nWhen the time comes to kick off, you\u2019ll find two match types. The first one is\nan 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise,\nfive-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific job, like\nscoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your player up the pitch,\nthen tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. When you tackle, everything pauses so\nyou can size up your opponent, then use various statistics to plan your play \u2013\ndodge or tackle.\nSpecial Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six,\nsuper-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or whenever\ncertain players level up. Even better are the brand new Fighting Spirits, which\nincrease players\u2019 statistics and allow for ever more powerful Special Moves to\nhelp you get the edge over the opposing team.\nWhen you\u2019re not on the pitch, you can explore the local area, check things out,\nand talk to people to get the lowdown on school life. Later on, you\u2019ll be able\nto go to visit Inazuma town and stop off at places like the Shopping Area or the\nRoyal Academy. It all looks gorgeous in full 3D, too!\nSaving the Raimon Jr. High from Fifth Sector is only part of the package, as\nthere\u2019s a stack of other challenges to tackle. Test your skills against up to\nthree friends in Local Play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players\nduring Story Mode. You can get new characters and items via SpotPass, or use\nStreetPass to receive other players&#39; team data and play matches against\nthem.\nSo, if you\u2019re a football fan and reckon you\u2019ve got what it takes to put together\nthe very best team from over a thousand players, sign up with Inazuma Eleven GO:\nLight or Inazuma Eleven GO: Shadow today \u2013 game on!\nGo on an exciting adventure, as new heroes attempt to save youth football from a\nstrange organisation  \nRecruit and trade the ultimate football team from over a thousand potential\nplayers, each with unique stats  \nUtilise powerful Special Moves and new Fighting Spirits to tip the game in your\nfavour  \nEnjoy local multiplayer matches with up to three friends, and take on other\nplayers&amp;#39; teams via StreetPass"

The game features full camera\nrotation and optional first-person view. Like in the previous Dragon Quest\ngames, many objects can be interacted with; for example, barrels can be\nphysically lifted, carried, and broken, to reveal items hidden within.\nIn addition to experience points, the player receives skill points from battles,\nwhich can be manually allocated into a skill category of the player&#39;s\nchoice. These categories include three different kinds of weapons, fisticuffs,\nand a discipline unique to each character. After a required amount of skill\npoints has been invested into a particular category, the correspondent character\nlearns a new ability or becomes more proficient with the chosen weapon. The\nAlchemy Pot system allows players to gather recipes and mix items to create new\nones.\nThe international version of the game features several updates to the original\nJapanese version, including voice acting, graphic menu, symphonic soundtracks,\nand flashier effects."

It is a 2D side-scroller that is not divided into\nseveral levels but rather takes place in one interconnected world. The game\nmostly consists of fighting enemies, solving puzzles, platforming sections,\ninteracting with different NPC that can give you quests or sell useful items.\nSince Shantae abandoned her genie powers, in this game you do not use magic\nabilities, instead of throughout the game you collect different pirate items\nsuch as a pistol, a pirate hat, pirate boots, scimitar, and cannon. Each of them\ngives player new abilities that help in combat, puzzle solving or open\npreviously closed areas of the game world."

New\nfootie stars, new moves and a whole new adventure\u2019s kicking off in Inazuma\nEleven GO: Light and Inazuma Eleven GO: Shadow on Nintendo 3DS family systems!\nTen years after Inazuma Eleven 3, newbie Arion Sherwind is putting on his Raimon\nHigh soccer kit. It\u2019s his first day, and he\u2019s revved up to be joining the\nschool\u2019s famous football club. But after a weird kid appears on the pitch, Arion\nworks out the club is going to be closed down by a shady company called Fifth\nSector, the big bosses in charge of youth football. Time to lace up!\nBefore you even think about going near a ball, you\u2019ve got to make a choice\nbetween two editions, Light and Shadow. The core content is the same, but there\nare unique characters, techniques and teams (among other things) to each. Which\none will you choose?\nAfter you join the school football club, you\u2019ll need to recruit a team \u2013 and a\n\u2018good\u2019 one won\u2019t be enough. There are two ways to shape your squad: first, you\ncould thrash another team in a five-a-side Battle, and get a request to join\nfrom an opposition player. You could also buy some PalPack Cards from dealers.\nThink of them as brochures for new players, complete with stats and sign-up\nrequirements. As you play more and more, you can potentially meet over a\nthousand players, but you only get 16 slots for your team, and just 110 for the\nentire roster, so pick carefully!\nWhen the time comes to kick off, you\u2019ll find two match types. The first one is\nan 11-man game that lasts ten minutes, while the other is a surprise,\nfive-a-side bash that gives you a single minute to achieve a specific job, like\nscoring a goal. You play by using the stylus to move your player up the pitch,\nthen tap to kick, pass or mark opponents. When you tackle, everything pauses so\nyou can size up your opponent, then use various statistics to plan your play \u2013\ndodge or tackle.\nSpecial Moves are back, as well. These give each of your players up to six,\nsuper-powered, anime-style tricks, which you get during the story or whenever\ncertain players level up. Even better are the brand new Fighting Spirits, which\nincrease players\u2019 statistics and allow for ever more powerful Special Moves to\nhelp you get the edge over the opposing team.\nWhen you\u2019re not on the pitch, you can explore the local area, check things out,\nand talk to people to get the lowdown on school life. Later on, you\u2019ll be able\nto go to visit Inazuma town and stop off at places like the Shopping Area or the\nRoyal Academy. It all looks gorgeous in full 3D, too!\nSaving the Raimon Jr. High from Fifth Sector is only part of the package, as\nthere\u2019s a stack of other challenges to tackle. Test your skills against up to\nthree friends in Local Play, including two-on-two matches, or trade players\nduring Story Mode. You can get new characters and items via SpotPass, or use\nStreetPass to receive other players&#39; team data and play matches against\nthem.\nSo, if you\u2019re a football fan and reckon you\u2019ve got what it takes to put together\nthe very best team from over a thousand players, sign up with Inazuma Eleven GO:\nLight or Inazuma Eleven GO: Shadow today \u2013 game on!\nGo on an exciting adventure, as new heroes attempt to save youth football from a\nstrange organisation  \nRecruit and trade the ultimate football team from over a thousand potential\nplayers, each with unique stats  \nUtilise powerful Special Moves and new Fighting Spirits to tip the game in your\nfavour  \nEnjoy local multiplayer matches with up to three friends, and take on other\nplayers&amp;#39; teams via StreetPass"

            "description": "Dragon Quest is the first role-playing video game (RPG) in the Dragon Quest\nmedia franchise. It was developed by Chunsoft for the Family Computer (or\nFamicom for short) and published by Enix in Japan in 1986 as Dragon Quest and by\nNintendo in 1989 in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES)\nas Dragon Warrior. Dragon Quest has been ported and remade for several video\ngame platforms, including the MSX, PC-9801, Super Famicom, Game Boy Color,\nNintendo 3DS, PlayStation 4 and mobile phones. In play, players control a hero\ncharacter who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its\nprincess from the evil Dragonlord. Dragon Warrior&#39;s story became the second\npart in a trilogy. Several more anime and manga games, which revolved around\nthis overarching plot were created.\nDragon Quest was created by Yuji Horii, who took inspiration from previous\nrole-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia\nSerial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide\naudience of people who were unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general.\nHe tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement,\nas well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre\nto the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira\nToriyama produced the game&#39;s artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music.\nThe North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed\nRAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character\nsprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.\nDragon Quest was commercially successful in Japan, with more than 2 million\ncopies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other Western\ncountries, was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the\ngame&#39;s shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its\noriginal pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised in many of these\nreviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game.\nThe game&#39;s sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been\nperformed at numerous concerts. As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited\nwith establishing the basic template for the Japanese console RPGs that\nfollowed."

This\ncaptivating hand-held Adventure will have new and experienced fans of\nthe Paper Mario series captivated as they navigate colorful 3D\nenvironments, defeat enemies, collect oodles of stickers and items and\nuse them in a variety of fun ways.\nFEATURES\nStickers are the key to this imaginative adventure.

Stickers can be found and collected from all corners of the\nworld, and the flashier the sticker, the more powerful it is.\nMario can also spend coins to use the Battle Spinner, which lets him\nuse up to 3 stickers in one turn if the icons are lined up just right.\nThe Battle Spinner can turn the tide in a difficult battle, so\ncollecting coins through the game to use it is crucial.\nPaper Mario: Sticker Star players get stronger by beating bosses,\nfinding items and completing side missions for other characters in the\ngame instead of accumulating experience points.\nAs players progress through the game, they&#39;ll find and use more\npowerful stickers to boost Mario&#39;s attack power. Players can also find\nHP-Up hearts to further boost Mario&#39;s maximum health.\nThe environments in Paper Mario: Sticker Star come to life in this\nvisually-stunning papercraft world on the Nintendo 3DS family of\nsystems. They also contain a wide range of objects such as electric\nfans, scissors and radiators that can be converted into more stickers,\nwhich can then be used to solve puzzles or win battles as Mario\nmaneuvers through each level."

The game was released in North America and the PAL region for the\nNintendo Entertainment System in late 1988, almost two years after its initial\nrelease in Japan.\nThe Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to the original The Legend of Zelda,\nagain involving the protagonist, Link, on a quest to save Princess Zelda, who\nhas fallen under a sleeping spell. The Adventure of Link&#39;s emphasis on\nside-scrolling and role-playing elements, however, was a significant departure\nfrom its predecessor. As of 2016, the game remains the only technical sequel to\nthe original title, as all other entries in the series either are prequels or\ntake place in an alternative reality, according to the official Zelda timeline.\nThe game was a critical and financial success, and introduced elements such as\nLink&#39;s &quot;magic meter&quot; and the Dark Link character that would become\ncommonplace in future Zelda games, although the role-playing elements, such as\nexperience points, and the platform-style side-scrolling and limited lives have\nnot been used since in canonical games. The Adventure of Link was followed by\nThe Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super Nintendo Entertainment\nSystem in 1992."

She ends up falling for the words of\ntravelling hero and running away from home to be prot\u00e9g\u00e9 to Orson. It's only\nafter that she realizes her mistake, Orson is a world class swindler and Kietha\nis a coward, deathly afraid of even the smallest of monsters.\r\nLink\nPolite, caring, and selfless. Known across the land as the Hero of Time and\nsavior of Hyrule, from the outside he is the perfect painting of a fairytale\nhero. However, his years of being forever connected to destiny and legends have\naffected him in ways that not many people can see. In order to be the role model\neveryone expects him to be, he's locked away his true self.\r\nSide Characters:\r\nOrson\r\nA pompous, self-centered, master manipulator. He travels the world under the\nguise of a hero for hire. Those who fall for his tricks are taken for all that\nthey are worth. His talents include running, hiding, and having a decent idea of\nhow a sword works. However, as harmless as he looks he's still not to be taken\nlightly less you want to find a knife in your back.\r\nZelda\r\nKind yet firm. After the death of her father, she was made Queen of Hyrule at a\nyoung age. She is the primary force behind the resurrection of Hyrule to its\nformal glory before the time of Ganondorf. In lighter times, she treats Link as\na brother, as they are both prone to bickering when it comes to the dangerous\nquests that he partakes in. However, by ignoring potential warning signs in her\neffort for peace, an evil has begun to take root in the shadows.\r\nErina \nSmart, patient, but evil to her core. An earth mage and once a faithful follower\nof Ganondorf, she was unable to stop the end of her master's glorious reign. For\nthe past three years she's been silently gathering power and knowledge in order\nto free Ganondorf from the sacred realm. The mysterious disappearances of the\nsages and the recent influx of monsters and minions are her doing.\r\nGanondorf\r\nArrogant, power-hungry, king of evil. Even in his prison, Ganondorf has\ncontinued to plot with Erina behind the scenes. It's unknown what his ultimate\nscheme is, but in his time of forced solitude, he has developed a deep seeded\nhatred for the hero that put him there. He will stop at nothing to make him\nsuffer.\r\nFeatures:\nOne Romance3 CGs12 BGs4 Endings30,000+ wordsLemma Soft Thread\nWarnings: Some light language and violence\nGame made with Ren'Py\nAll music royalty free found here: http://incompetech.com/music/\nAll sound effects royalty free found here: http://www.freesfx.co.uk/\nAll things Legend of Zelda belong to the company Nintendo."

Players assume the role of a Nintendo or Sega character,\nusing the Wii Remote to mimic sports actions such as swinging a paddle. The DS\nversion uses the stylus and button controls. Both games follow rules and\nregulations of the specific sports. Sega adopted the IOC&#39;s mission of\npromoting a sportsmanship and interest young people in the Olympics by using its\ncharacters; following this theme, Nintendo allowed Sega to include Mario with\nSonic the Hedgehog, created by Sega as a mascot to rival Mario in the early\n1990s."

            "description": "Dragon Quest is the first role-playing video game (RPG) in the Dragon Quest\nmedia franchise. It was developed by Chunsoft for the Family Computer (or\nFamicom for short) and published by Enix in Japan in 1986 as Dragon Quest and by\nNintendo in 1989 in North America for the Nintendo Entertainment System (or NES)\nas Dragon Warrior. Dragon Quest has been ported and remade for several video\ngame platforms, including the MSX, PC-9801, Super Famicom, Game Boy Color,\nNintendo 3DS, PlayStation 4 and mobile phones. In play, players control a hero\ncharacter who is charged with saving the Kingdom of Alefgard and rescuing its\nprincess from the evil Dragonlord. Dragon Warrior&#39;s story became the second\npart in a trilogy. Several more anime and manga games, which revolved around\nthis overarching plot were created.\nDragon Quest was created by Yuji Horii, who took inspiration from previous\nrole-playing games such as Wizardry, Ultima, and his own 1983 title The Portopia\nSerial Murder Case. Horii wanted to create an RPG which would appeal to a wide\naudience of people who were unfamiliar with the genre of video games in general.\nHe tried to place a greater emphasis on storytelling and emotional involvement,\nas well as simplify the interface and expose the mostly Western computer genre\nto the Japanese console market. Manga artist and Dragon Ball creator Akira\nToriyama produced the game&#39;s artwork and Koichi Sugiyama composed its music.\nThe North American version featured numerous changes, including battery-backed\nRAM save games (rather than using a password save system), modified character\nsprites and pseudo-Elizabethan English style dialog.\nDragon Quest was commercially successful in Japan, with more than 2 million\ncopies sold. Its release as Dragon Warrior in North America, and other Western\ncountries, was less favorably received. Later, Western critics noted the\ngame&#39;s shortcomings but acknowledged its importance to the genre. Its\noriginal pseudo-Elizabethan English script has been praised in many of these\nreviews. Fan-made ROM hacks were released with substantial changes to the game.\nThe game&#39;s sound effects have also been orchestrated, and its music has been\nperformed at numerous concerts. As a whole, Dragon Warrior has been credited\nwith establishing the basic template for the Japanese console RPGs that\nfollowed."

            "description": "The fourth game in the Scribblenauts series follows the same basic mechanics as\nthe previous three. You play as Max, who owns a magic notebook. Scribe any word\nin it, and it becomes real (of course, only if the word you wrote describes a\nparticular object). The game will understand your written words and create\ninteractive in-game objects. They are used to solve puzzles, which earns you\nStarites, the ultimate goal of the game. The ability to summon any imaginable\nitem gives you an almost unlimited number of ways you can solve any puzzle.\nScribblenauts Unlimited features a way more detailed plot than its predecessors.\nThere&#39;s an extensive backstory that explains the protagonist&#39;s\nmotivation in gathering Starites. We learn that Max and his sister Lily played\npranks on people using their magic notebook until it got them into trouble. One\nday they unknowingly played a trick against an old wizard. He grew angry and\nmagically turned Lily into stone. Max can only save his sister by gathering\nenough Starites. Unlike previous parts, this game is set in an open, albeit\ncartoonish, world, that gradually opens to you as you gather more Starites. The\ntasks are now assigned by the NPCs, and Starites are given as a reward for help.\nThus, they serve as the proof that Max has corrected his behavior."

There is a catch, though; the adversary has been\nfeeding her with the cake that grows in a nearby forest to make her heavier to\ncarry.

The name of the game is cooperation,\nwhether it&#39;s flinging another player over the enemy&#39;s walls with a\nteeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding your muscle to\ncarry the princess faster."

Trying to figure out what\u2019s going on, Simon\nfinds Catherine Chun, a scientist, who tells him about the technology of copying\nthe human personality.\nThe gameplay is based on exploration and puzzle solving. There&#39;s no combat,\nand you are meant to avoid enemies and act stealthily. To progress through the\nstory, you need to search for clues, read multiple notes and solve puzzles.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nThough there are monsters in SOMA, it frightens with its atmosphere in the first\nplace. A dark, abandoned station with dead people, uncertainty and the lack of\nany understanding of what is waiting for you is scarier than screamers and blood\nrivers. Moral choices you have to make don\u2019t affect the story much: instead,\nthey change your attitude to the events, so it\u2019s you who develops through the\ngame."

The plot takes\nplace in the high fantasy world of Middle-Earth. Bilbo Baggins, the main\nprotagonist, is a hobbit. He lived a peaceful life until one day a company of\nthirteen dwarves and the wizard named Gandalf called him to join them on an\nadventure. Bilbo and his new friends left out on a quest to reconquer the\ndwarves&#39; home, the Lonely Mountain, and its treasures from the wicked dragon\nSmaug. \nGameplay\nThe player controls the Thorin&#39;s party, switching between characters when\nneeded. Each character has his unique abilities, such as climbing or shooting\narrows. The game is divided into a series of short, linear levels that\ncorrespond to certain scenes in the movies. On the way, the player has to smash\nobjects made of LEGO and sometimes use them to assemble new objects. The game\nalso has a cooperative multiplayer for two."

            "description": "Adventure is a video game for the Atari 2600 video game console, released in\nlate 1979\u20131980. In the game, the player controls a square avatar whose quest is\nto explore an open-ended environment to find a magical chalice and return it to\nthe golden castle. The game world is populated by roaming enemies: three dragons\nthat can eat the avatar and a bat that randomly steals and hides items around\nthe game world. Adventure introduced a number of innovative game elements to\nconsole games, including a playing area that spanned several different screens\nand enemies that continued to move even when not displayed on the screen.\nAdventure was conceived as a graphical version of the 1977 text adventure\nColossal Cave Adventure. It took developer Warren Robinett approximately one\nyear to design and code the game, during which time he had to overcome a variety\nof technical limitations in the Atari 2600 console hardware, as well as\ndifficulties with management within Atari. In this game, he introduced the first\nwidely known video game Easter egg, a secret room containing text crediting\nhimself for the game&#39;s creation. Robinett&#39;s Easter egg became a\ntradition for future Atari 2600 titles.\nAdventure received mostly positive reviews at the time of its release and has\ncontinued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of\nthe industry&#39;s influential titles. It is considered the first\naction-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the\ngenres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game\nhas been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer\nhardware. The game&#39;s prototype code was used as the basis for the 1979\nSuperman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the basis for the\nSwordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended\nvideo games and entered popular culture."

Based on\nan unfinished game titled Cosmos and inspired by Spacewar!, Computer Space, and\nSpace Invaders, Asteroids&#39; physics model, control scheme and gameplay theme\nwere derived from these earlier games and refined through trial and error.

            "description": "You may need to zoom out to play the game in browser.\nWhat the basic concept is.\nThe basic concept is that you are a printer. You must change the colors of\nblocks until you can arrange every color into a glorious colour ring.\nHow colors work.\nThe three primary colors are cyan, magenta, and yellow.\nCyan + Magenta = Blue\nCyan + Yellow = Green\nYellow + Magenta = Red\nThe \u201copposite\u201d of a color is the primary or secondary color that it is not\nassociated with. E.g. the opposite of Magenta is Green, and the opposite of Blue\nis Yellow.\nHow functions work.\nFunctions are made of two (or three) parts. They can only be vertical. In order\nto work, a block must pass over a conveyor between the key block and the\napplyable colours.\nThe \u201ckey block\u201d on the bottom determines which color is added to a block that\npasses through the function. The 'Applyable' block(s) on the top determine what\ncolors of blocks it can apply to.\nIf a black block is placed under the key block, the function removes color\ninstead of adding it.\nThe second and third screenshots show a white block being passed through a\nfunction which can add yellow to only white blocks. The fourth and fifth\nscreenshots show how a function which removes colour instead of adding it would\nwork by removing Magenta from a Blue block (Blue = Magenta + Cyan).\nAdding all primary colors together will result in black\nIf a color combination doesn\u2019t work, then the function does nothing. For\nexample, having a secondary color as a key block won\u2019t do anything.\nIf you've made a successful function a white border will appear around the whole\nfunction, indicating where the function extends to.\nHow inputs and outputs work.\nWhen an input tile is placed, a white block is automatically spawned on top of\nit. That block now \u201cbelongs\u201d to that input tile.\nWhen a block (that belongs to an input tile that still exists) passes over an\noutput tile, a block of opposite color is spawned at its input tile. The block\non the output tile is destroyed.\nThe starting three blocks were not created from an input tile, and therefore\nwill not be affected by an output tile.\nHow conveyors and turns work.\nConveyors move blocks. They can be rotated before placing them, either by\nscrolling or with e and q.\nBlocks on a conveyor move one space per turn. Turns are passed by\nright-clicking.\nHow to win!\nThe final goal is to arrange one block of each color in a ring, in the order\nshown in the first screenshot. (If the big finished icon doesn't appear when you\nfinish you might have hidden it underneath the other game sprites.)\nControls.\nE/Q &amp; Scroll Wheel: Rotates a conveyor whilst you're holding it.\nEscape: Drops the tile you're holding (Conveyor, Input Tile, Output Tile,\nDestructo-pad).\nLeft click: Lets you pick up stuff.\nRight click: Lets you pass turns.\nChallenge Mode.\nChallenge mode is the intended gameplay experience. However, we recommend you\nonly try it after you've beaten standard mode and gotten your head around the\nway the game works. Challenge mode requires you to think far ahead and plan many\nsteps in advance. In challenge mode the only restriction is that you cannot\ndestroy or change conveyors. You can still destroy and replace inputs and\noutputs (we'd be interested to hear if you can do it without even that).\nThe first screenshot is of what it looks like to beat challenge mode. Don't just\ncopy, it doesn't work like that anyway.\nSuper-Ultra Challenge Mode.\nThere's no setting in the game for this but, if you want a real challenge, try\nbeating the game while splitting the game into two periods. In the first period\nyou can place and destroy whatever you want. You are not allowed to press right\nclick during this period. In the second period you are only allowed to right\nclick until you (hopefully) beat the game through your careful planning.\nIntegration of the themes.\nOriginally, we planned to use chain reactions and negative feedback loops, but\nthe concept changed quite a bit. We wanted to have chain reactions by having\nseveral functions in a row that combined to do cool and unique things. In the\nfinal version, this really isn\u2019t necessary, so it\u2019s hardly a part of the game\nanymore. This kind of happened when we realised just how cool it would be if you\nphysically built the functions out of blocks. It was a natural step given we\nwere allready representing them the same way in planning.\nFor the negative feedback loops, we implemented them using the system of inputs\nand outputs. The negative feedback loops gives you the opposite of what you put\nin which creates what seems to us to be a pretty cool mecthanic.\nDiversifiers used:\nJoin the Trijam Discord and read the #rules channel!Invite your friends to join\nthe game jam!

It was released\nas one of the nine launch titles for the system in September 1977, and was\nincluded in the box with the system from its introduction until 1982. Combat was\nbased on two earlier black-and-white coin-operated arcade games produced by\nAtari: Tank (published under the Kee Games name) in 1974 and Jet Fighter in\n1975.\nEarlier in 1977, Coleco had released the similarly titled Telstar Combat!, an\nentry in its Telstar series of dedicated consoles. Unlike the Coleco game,\nCombat had color graphics and numerous gameplay variations. The 27 game modes\nfeatured a variety of different combat scenarios, including tanks, biplanes, and\njet fighters. The tank games had interesting options such as bouncing munitions\n(\\\"Tank-Pong\\\") and invisibility. The biplane and jet games also allowed for\nvariation, such as multiple planes per player and an inventive game with a\nsquadron of planes versus one giant bomber. Atari also produced a version of\nCombat for Sears titled Tank Plus (alluding to the original arcade game Tank).\nCombat was programmed by Joe Decuir and Larry Wagner."

In the game, Mario (originally named Mr.\nVideo and then Jumpman) must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline\n(originally named Lady), from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape\nlater became two of Nintendo&#39;s most popular and recognizable characters.\nDonkey Kong is one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade\nvideo games, and is one of the most popular arcade games of all time.\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the\nNorth American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo&#39;s president at the time,\nassigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto.\nDrawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the\nBeast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game\nalongside Nintendo&#39;s chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new\nground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to\nadvance the game&#39;s plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\nDespite initial doubts by Nintendo&#39;s American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded\ncommercially and critically in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the\ngame to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms.\nOther companies cloned Nintendo&#39;s hit and avoided royalties altogether.\nMiyamoto&#39;s characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and\ndozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging\nDonkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The\nsuccess of Donkey Kong and Nintendo&#39;s victory in the courtroom helped to\nposition the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981\nuntil the late 1990s (1996\u20131999)."

It is based on the film of the same name, and was designed by Howard\nScott Warshaw. The objective of the game is to guide the eponymous character\nthrough various screens in a cubic world to collect three pieces of an\ninterplanetary telephone that will allow him to contact his home planet.\nWarshaw intended the game to be an innovative adaptation of the film, and Atari\nthought it would achieve high sales figures based on its connection with the\nfilm, which was extremely popular throughout the world. Negotiations to secure\nthe rights to make the game ended in late July 1982, giving Warshaw only 5 and a\nhalf weeks to develop the game in time for the 1982 Christmas season. The final\nrelease was critically panned, with nearly every aspect of the game facing heavy\ncriticism. E.T. is often cited as one of the worst video games of all time and\none of the biggest commercial failures in video game history. It is considered\nto be one of the most significant titles in the history of video games, as it is\ncited as a major contributing factor to the video game industry crash of 1983,\nand has been frequently referenced and mocked in popular culture in the years\nsince its release, often being used as a cautionary tale about the dangers of\nrushed game development and studio interference.\nReports from 1983 gave way to urban legend stating that as a result of\noverproduction and returns, millions of unsold cartridges were buried in an\nAlamogordo, New Mexico landfill. In 2013, plans were revealed to conduct an\nexcavation to determine the accuracy of reports about the burial, and in April\nof the following year, the diggers confirmed that the Alamogordo burial did\ninclude E.T. cartridges among other titles. James Heller, the former Atari\nmanager who was in charge of the original burial, was also on hand at the\nexcavation and revealed to the Associated Press that 728,000 cartridges of\nvarious titles were buried."

It was released as an arcade game in the fall of 1994 and,\nthe following year, ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and\nthe Game Boy. The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organising a\nfighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series\npublished under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of\nthe time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player\nhas two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first\nwins the match. The game also introduced \\\"auto-doubles\\\", a feature which\nallows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters\nautomatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \\\"combo\nbreakers\\\", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.\nCritically acclaimed, Killer Instinct was followed by a sequel, the 1996 arcade\ngame Killer Instinct 2, later ported to the Nintendo 64 as Killer Instinct Gold,\nas well as a 2013 revival of the franchise as a launch title for Xbox One. A\nport of the original game is included with the 2013 game under the title Killer\nInstinct Classic. Retrospective lists by various publications included it among\nthe best fighting games of all time."

Every 25% of the game\ncompleted results in the player being awarded a car as a special prize. For GT3,\nthe Gran Turismo Mode (Simulation Mode in the North American version) has a\nreorganized layout, with a more structured and progressive arrangement of races\nand challenges. Races vary from short beginner events to multi-hour endurance\nraces and also rallying events against an opponent. In addition, the car shops\nare now organized by country and then by manufacturer, which some find to be\nmore intuitive than the East/West City method used in its predecessor.\nThe Arcade Mode is reorganized in &quot;stages&quot;; these stages are made up\nof 5 or 6 tracks pooled from all available tracks in the game, including both\nroad and rally races. To get to the next stage, all tracks on a stage must be\ncompleted on Easy difficulty or higher. By beating the stage on Normal or\nDifficult, additional cars are unlocked as well for play in any mode of Arcade\nMode (including two-player battle and time trial).\nGT3 features 19 race courses, 14 of which have reverse variants&#39; and 4 of\nwhich are dirt tracks. Most of these circuits are at fictional locations, but\nCalifornia&#39;s Laguna Seca Raceway and C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur (which is heavily based on\nthe Monaco Grand Prix circuit) are not.\nOther changes include the omission of the ability to &quot;race modify&quot; or\nadd downforce to production cars, removal of suspension damage, and the absence\nof torque limits for races.\nNew to the franchise, GT3 also contained unlicensed versions of six actual\nFormula One cars, labelled as F686/M, F687/S, F688/S, F090/S, F094/H and F094/S\n(in the Japanese and American versions) that the player could win from endurance\nraces. In the Japanese and American versions, the name of each car denotes\nvarious pieces of information (such as the amount of cylinders in the engine,\nthe year the chassis was raced, and its driver, respectively). For example, the\na forementioned F094/S was the 10-cylinder, 1994-season car driven by Ayrton\nSenna, whereas the F686/M represented the 6-cylinder, 1986-season car driven by\nNigel Mansell. In the PAL release, however, there were only two F1 cars, not\nobviously based on any real-life counterparts and instead labelled as Polyphony\n001 and 002 respectively.\nGT3 also marks informal appearances of automakers Lamborghini and Porsche. A\nracing JGTC Lamborghini Diablo was featured in the NTSC-J version (where the car\nhas been cut from NTSC-U copy and being available in NTSC-U copy with a cheat\ndevice), and a Porsche 911 GT3 can be found in the game code (though it cannot\nbe obtained normally, and requires the use of a cheat device). Both cars,\ntogether with two hidden Lancia Stratoses (road and rally versions), however,\nare completely absent in PAL version. Lamborghini would make its first official\nappearance in 2009&#39;s Gran Turismo (PSP), while Porsche made its first\nofficial appearance in Gran Turismo Sport for the PlayStation 4."

It was developed for the Atari 8-bit\nfamily and widely ported to other systems.\nAs Bounty Bob, the player&#39;s goal is to inspect every section of each mine in\nsearch of the evil Yukon Yohan while avoiding the radioactive creatures that\ninhabit the mine. As Bounty Bob walks over a section of flooring, it fills with\ncolor. To complete the level, every section of flooring must be colored. There\nare ten mines in total (eleven in the ColecoVision port). Each level is timed\nand must be completed before the player runs out of oxygen.\nObjects in each mine aid and hinder Bob&#39;s progress. Ladders allow him to\nclimb up or down to the next platform, chutes slide Bob off a platform (often\nagainst his will), and pulverizers crush Bob if he gets in their way. Some\nitems, if picked up, can also garner the player extra points."

            "description": "\\\"A fun and functional app for adults and children alike.\\\" - AppAdvice.com\nSpyLight is the first iPhone 4 application that both sends AND receives Morse\nCode. Finally, you can translate a Morse Code signal without having to\nunderstand it! We have also added a torch as an extra feature.\nIt has been tested up to 200 meters at night, but might work even further away \u2013\nwe ran out of room to see! Play with your friends and send secret messages using\nthe 'code' button too. \nHow to use -\nYou can send Morse Code in the traditional manner with the flash by typing in\nmessages with the keyboard and pressing 'send'. You also have a view finder\nwhich can receive the signal from another SpyLight enabled iPhone 4. (or any\niPhone / iPod touch that has a flash installed in future.) To get best results\nkeep the incoming flashes as central as possible on the target, although\nSpyLight does allow for a reasonable amount of wobble, especially at bigger\ndistances.\nTo try and give you a second or two to lock onto an incoming message SpyLight\nwill precede your text with a few full stops. If you catch one half way through\nits' signal this may translate as a random character but will not effect the\nfollowing message. Of course, you can let other SpyLight users know you are\nabout to send a message by switching on the torch before pressing 'send'.\nSpyLight has a 'code' button that jumbles up traditional signals and if\nintercepted will just translate as random data. Make sure both parties use the\nsame code to be able to translate the signals back to your original message.\nPlease note that code 0 is traditional Morse Code so you can even send  to those\nlucky people who can translate by eye.\nIf someone seems too far away from you SpyLight also provides a 'zoom' feature\non the viewfinder (controlled by a 'slider' in the centre of the screen). This\ncan make it much easier to keep your tracking target on the incoming signal. You\nwill be amazed how far away it can work.\nThe torch is switched on and off using the torch icon in the top left of the\nview finder. It is always automatically switched off if you send a message.\nExtra support at www.squeakysoftware.com\nSpyLight Specifications -\nCurrently only runs on iPhone 4 (or later) as it requires the camera flash. If a\nnew generation of iPod touch adds a flash it should work on those too.\nRequires the use of at least iOS 4.2 to run. If you have an older version, it is\nquite easy to update it from iTunes. \nFor best results use with at least 1 friend who also has SpyLight.\nSpyLight is unlikely to translate other Morse Code signals as timings will\nprobably be different. However, you will notice that SpyLight is one of the\nfastest Morse Code signallers of all the Applications available.\nSpyLight works best at night. It's pretty good even at dusk, but works less well\nin daytime.\nWhile SpyLight is both a fun utility and Morse Code sender it does use a\nflashing light. Please be aware if you are susceptible to these flashes.\n-  ....  .-  -.  -.-     -.--  ---  ..- !"

The Ego system offers a\nfine-grained control of difficulty on a per-user basis, which has been widely\npraised for leveling the playing field in cooperative and competitive modes.\nThis system will push seasoned gamers to their limits while simultaneously\nproviding a gentle introduction for beginners.\nUp-to Four Player Local Co-op Play: In addition to solo play, players can try\ntheir hand at head-to-head, 2v1, 2v2 and co-op against the CPU. In co-op mode,\nteammates alternate batting/running each time at-bat, and alternate\npitching/fielding each inning, meaning ballplayers need to be on their toes\nevery play. To even games, players can use the Ego system to set up a\ncompetitive game between friends of any skill level.\nUltra Responsive and Blazing Fast Gameplay: Controls are easy to learn, but\nplayers will need to master jumping, diving, wall-catches, power-swings and\ncut-off plays to properly dominate friends. Short load times and a streamlined\ninterface means most of the time is spent in the action, with nine-inning games\ntaking around 20 minutes to play.\nFull Batting and Pitching Statistics: Most baseball statistics imaginable are\navailable and ballplayers can use these to show off their MVP-quality skills.\nLeveling System: Players tally up Starpoints for hits, strikeouts and catches\nduring each game and Level Up once they collect enough points. Players can hire\nstaff to train and coach their squad, improving skill attributes such as Power\nand Speed. Use that jacked up team to win at higher difficulties (and post\nhigher leaderboard scores than friends)!\nPlayer Customization: Customize the look and names of a team\u2019s players to create\na ragtag crew of family and friends.

When a mysterious pyramid\nstructure was discovered during the 1969 moon landing, humanity began focusing\nless on our planet and more on the stars. After years of research, humanity\nfinally discovered a way to enter the strange monolith, but there was a catch:\nevery person who entered never came back out. With volunteers dwindling, a\nbounty was raised to entice new explorers: $150 billion to the first person who\ncan successfully enter and exit the pyramid.EXPLOREIn SENTINEL, you assume the\nrole of a nameless bounty hunter. Your goal is to explore every inch of the\nlevel and try to learn what this strange pyramid really is. The game is played\nin one large level that features 13 unique rooms for you to explore on your\njourney. while this task seems tough, you'll be well equipped for your journey\nin your Nanite Suit.\nFIGHTWith the Nanite Suit, you'll be able to navigate the terrain of this\nunexplored labyrinth, and you'll be able to fight back against the many strange\nfoes that await you. This game features five unique enemy types found across the\nmap, and two boss encounters to really test your skill. \nGROW STRONGERAs you explore, you'll find new upgrades for your Nanite Suit that\nchange the way the game is played. Whether it's vaulting off of enemies or\nblasting through the sky, you'll keep adding tools to your arsenal as you\nprogress. Each ability you unlock allows you to explore, fight, and move in new\nways. \nNobody knows what's in this thing. Nobody alive anyways. Maybe it's time you\nchanged that. Good luck!\nSENTINEL is a playable concept piece, and thus is fairly short (Like, less than\nan hour short). While we currently aren't actively developing more levels for\nthe game, we will continue to make bug fix and quality updates to this version\nof the game.

You also have a time to complete each room, if this time runs out,\ndepending on the game mode, you will lose the game and you must start the room\nfrom the beginning.\nThe game consists of two game modes:\nThe story mode that follows the patterns of mobile games, avoiding the way to\nplay retro, where you can repeat as many times as you want each level, and you\nwill open the next ones as you complete the previous one.The survival mode, has\nall the retro character of the game, where we will have 3 lives, and advance\nthrough the screens sequentially, as was the case in the original version of ZX\nspectrum. When you lose all three lives, you must start from the first screen.\nThe control of the game is simple, there are only the three operations of the\nretro game of amstrad CPC and ZX spectrum, moving the character to the right or\nleft, and being able to jump.\nIn the survival mode, the rooms are visited as in the ZX spectrum version,\nprogressively, while the story has it as the amstrad CPC verison, which allows\nthe rooms to be completed in order but can be repeated. Also in the survival\nmode, to give it the most retro character, it consists, as in amstrad CPC, of a\nhigher score.\nEnjoy, remembering your games to this magical version, one of the greatest hits\nof the 80s for personal computers.\nHow to play:\r\nThe arrow keys are used to move the character from left to right.\nThe spacebar serves for the character to jump or climb the stairs.\nP key for pause"

The player must avoid obstacles, such as trees and moguls. The game\ncartridge was programmed with five variations each of two principal games. In\nthe downhill mode, the player's goal is to reach the bottom of the ski course as\nrapidly as possible, while a timer records his relative success. In the slalom\nmode, the player must similarly reach the end of the course as rapidly as he\ncan, but must at the same time pass through a series of gates (indicated by a\npair of closely spaced flagpoles). Each gate missed counts as a penalty against\nthe player's time."

The game's look and feel is very similar to Popeye which was released the\nfollowing year, suggesting that the same development team were involved in both\nreleases. It was released in three types of arcade cabinets: Up-right, Small\nUp-right/Cabarat and Cocktail. It was later ported to the Atari 2600 by Parker\nBros. in 1983. The arcade version was rumored to be released only in Japan but\ncannot be proven and is now speculated was never released, while the Atari 2600\nversion was released only in North America.\nToday, this is a rare cabinet, as many of the original Sky Skipper boards were\nconverted into the better selling Popeye game. Recently, there was success in\nun-modding these back to the original game. The story of this project, and\nfootage from the game is online. Additionally an attempt to recreate two entire\ncabinets (one in the UK and one in the US) using the boards is underway."

It was originally\nmanufactured and sold by Taito in Japan, and was later licensed for production\nin the United States by the Midway division of Bally. Space Invaders is one of\nthe earliest shooting games and the aim is to defeat waves of aliens with a\nlaser cannon to earn as many points as possible. In designing the game,\nNishikado drew inspiration from popular media: Breakout, The War of the Worlds,\nand Star Wars. To complete it, he had to design custom hardware and development\ntools.\nIt was one of the forerunners of modern video gaming and helped expand the video\ngame industry from a novelty to a global industry (see Golden age of arcade\nvideo games). When first released, Space Invaders was very successful.\nThe game has been the inspiration for other video games, re-released on numerous\nplatforms, and led to several sequels. The 1980 Atari 2600 version quadrupled\nthe system&#39;s sales and became the first &quot;killer app&quot; for video\ngame consoles. Space Invaders has been referenced and parodied in multiple\ntelevision shows, and been a part of several video game and cultural\nexhibitions. The pixelated enemy alien has become a pop culture icon, often used\nas a synecdoche representing video games as a whole."

It was written by Doug Neubauer, an Atari\nemployee, and released in cartridge form by Atari in 1979. It was later ported\nto other Atari computer and game platforms.\nThe game simulates 3D space combat between the player's ship and an invading\nfleet of alien \\\"Zylon\\\" vessels. Star Raiders was distinctive for its graphics,\nwhich, in addition to various map and long range scan views, provided forward\nand aft first-person views, with movement conveyed by a streaming 3D starfield\nas the player engaged enemy spacecraft. The game's attract mode, a simple\nstreaming star field, was a common sight in computer stores of the early-1980s\nto show off the Atari computers' graphics capabilities. The game is commonly\nreferred to as the platform's killer app.\nWhile there had already been simple target-shooting games using the first person\nperspective (including 1977's Starhawk), Star Raiders had considerably higher\nquality graphics and more complex game play. As a result it inspired imitators\nthroughout the 1980s as well as later-generation space combat simulation games.\nNotably, it is one of the games that inspired the seminal title Elite, and thus\nthe Wing Commander series. It is also one in a string of first person space\nshooters (including 1977's Starhawk and 1979's Star Fire) that appeared in the\nlate-1970s and were arguably predecessors of the later seen first-person shooter\ngenre.\nIn 2007, Star Raiders was included as #2 in a list of the 10 most important\nvideo games of all time, as compiled by Stanford University's History of Science\nand Technology Collections."

            "description": "Warlords is an arcade game released by Atari, Inc. in 1980. The game resembles a\ncombination of Breakout and Quadrapong (an early Atari arcade game) in the sense\nthat not only can up to 4 players play the game at the same time, but also the\n&quot;castles&quot; in the four corners of the screen are brick walls that could\nbe broken with a flaming ball.\nWarlords uses spinner controllers for player control, and came in both an\nupright 2 player version and a 4 player cocktail version. The upright version\nuses a black and white monitor, and reflects the game image onto a mirror, with\na backdrop of castles, giving the game a 3D feel. The upright version only\nsupports up to two simultaneous players, which move through the levels as a\nteam. The cocktail version is in color, and supports 1-4 players. 3-4 player\ngames are free-for-all&#39;s where the game ends as soon as one player wins. 1-2\nplayer games play identical to the upright version.\nAccording to the Atari video game production numbers, 1014 uprights were made,\nand 1253 cocktails were produced. The prototype version of Warlords was called\n&quot;Castles and Kings&quot; and was housed in a 4 player &quot;Sprint 4\nlike&quot; cabinet - it was huge. Only 2 versions of the prototype were made.\nThe game was considered a success, although the large cabinet made it impossible\nto produce in large quantities nor was it feasible to install - hence the\nsmaller cocktail design."

An early example of the platform game genre, the gameplay\nfocuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while\ndodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, Mario (originally named Mr.\nVideo and then Jumpman) must rescue a damsel in distress named Pauline\n(originally named Lady), from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape\nlater became two of Nintendo&#39;s most popular and recognizable characters.\nDonkey Kong is one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade\nvideo games, and is one of the most popular arcade games of all time.\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the\nNorth American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo&#39;s president at the time,\nassigned the project to a first-time video game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto.\nDrawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the\nBeast, and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game\nalongside Nintendo&#39;s chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new\nground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cutscenes to\nadvance the game&#39;s plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\nDespite initial doubts by Nintendo&#39;s American staff, Donkey Kong succeeded\ncommercially and critically in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the\ngame to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms.\nOther companies cloned Nintendo&#39;s hit and avoided royalties altogether.\nMiyamoto&#39;s characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and\ndozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging\nDonkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The\nsuccess of Donkey Kong and Nintendo&#39;s victory in the courtroom helped to\nposition the company for video game market dominance from its release in 1981\nuntil the late 1990s (1996\u20131999)."

While we currently aren't actively developing more levels for\nthe game, we will continue to make bug fix and quality updates to this version\nof the game. If you'd like to show your support for the game, report a bug, make\na suggestion, or just chat with the developers, please join the discord server\nlinked on this Steam page!"
