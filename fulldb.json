            "description": "In the mysterious night sky floats the \"Dark Moon,\" endowed with strange powers, above \"Evershade Valley.\" Dr. E. Gadd, a researcher of ghosts, lived happily among cheerful and lively specters. However, one day, a dark shadow crept in... \"King Boo\" shattered the Dark Moon into pieces. This caused ominous fog to envelop Evershade Valley, and the ghosts suddenly began to run amok! Luigi, reluctantly summoned by Dr. E. Gadd, embarks on an investigation of Evershade Valley to gather the scattered shards of the Dark Moon. Can Luigi truly restore peace to Evershade Valley...? Additionally, there's a mode called \"Terror Tower,\" where players aim from the first floor to the top of the tower, and up to four players can enjoy cooperative play. In addition to online play, you can also play with up to four players via local communication.",
