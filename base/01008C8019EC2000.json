    "description": "Catarina Claes is a young woman born into a family of nobility who has a memory of her past life as a high school student. She was reincarnated as a Villainess in an otome game called Fortune Lover. Exile or death were all that awaited her in this new world. However, she managed to evade these ends, and somehow made it through the year to spring break.\n\nAs fate would have it, both Catarina and her adopted brother, Keith, were to board a state-of-the-art luxury liner called the Vinculum on its maiden voyage during their time away from the Academy. Once aboard the ship, she realized her friends were also in attendance on what was meant to be a luxurious journey at sea.\n\nThe tides changed quickly when they were attacked by pirates who took over the Vinculum and held all of its passengers hostage.\n\nThis turn of events all seemed familiar to Catarina, and she begins to recall this was the storyline to a Fortune Lover fanbook.\n\nCould this mean she’s living in a resurrection of a canned doom ending?! Will Catarina and her friends be able to return to Sorcier safely?\n \nThe curtain rises for a new twist in this doom-flag-evading romantic comedy!\n\nKey Features\nUncharted Waters Ahead! – A new doom flag has risen in this all-new story set in the My Next Life as a Villainess universe!
