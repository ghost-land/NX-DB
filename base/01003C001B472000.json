    "description": "The place is U-chronia, a hazy world that lives in hazy memories of the distant past.\nOU, a young boy, wakes up in a dried up riverbed without any memories of his own.\nHe meets Zarry, an opossum with a flaming tail, who guides him on a journey to find out his story.\n\nThe Saudade Specter, who haunts the boy;\nGemini, who looks just like him;\nThe Weeping Woman \"La Llorona\", who leads him to tragedy.\nAll of them are there to change the Story and how it will end.\n\n\nA pen-drawn world reminiscent of the illustrations in children's literature, accompanied by music for guitar and other instruments ripe with nostalgia for an old hometown.\nThis is the background where the Story, a story meant for someone, unfolds.\n\n\"OU\" disguises itself as something else—an adventure game—to meet and interact with reality.\nOU is also a challenge—a challenge to games as a whole.",
