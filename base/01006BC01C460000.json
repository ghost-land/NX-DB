    "description": "In Druidwalker, the winter is just around the corner. The forest goes to sleep. You are a druid, preparing the forest for hibernation. Where will the paths of fallen leaves lead you?\n\nDruidwalker is an experimental game: click on the cards and see how far can you go. You won't get hints at the start of the game. You have to interact with it and figure things out as you go.\n\nFeatures:\n- Traverse the forest, encounter the animals; move at your own pace, there is no rush\n- A combination of hand-drawn images with traditional instrumental music\n- Peaceful roguelike: you can not lose here; there are no deaths, only breaks at the bonfire\n- A short, relaxing experience without pressure",
