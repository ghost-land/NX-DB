    "description": "Join Human Rocket Person on the adventure of a lifetime as he tries to save the universe. Jump your way through different levels on your incredible pogo stick. Fly with special abilities and master the awkward controls.\n\nFeatures:\nPogo jumping\nPlatforming\nJunk physics\nRainbow farts\n\nNote from the developers;\nThis game is incredibly hard, due to the intentional awkward controls and the level design. By the end of the game, you will hate us, the developers. It’s one of those games where you die a lot but in a funny way. We put a great effort into making a unique game full of surprises and weird moments. We hope the fun will over weigh the frustration, and that you will be happy that you overcame the struggles of playing it.",
