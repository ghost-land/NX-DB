    "description": "When the vicious Calaveras drug cartel raids his home, Kaktus breaks bad in a hardcore vendetta journey to save his foster family.\n\nThe combat-focused action is filled with enemies, explosions, and an abundance of pop culture-fostered elements. \n\nGO ON A RAMPAGE\nYou can choose the way you want to fight your enemies – the end justifies the extreme measures you'll need to take. Use Kaktus's rage mode to make sure the thugs get what they deserve. Fuel up with tequila and other adrenaline-pumping substances to annihilate the cartel into oblivion. \n\nOR DO THINGS QUIETLY. \nIf you don't want to find yourself directly fighting the bandits without a plan, you can use the many options available – dodge bullets, equip different armor, use the interactive environment, and set traps to get rid of enemies in a more subtle way. Would you prefer to do things quietly and sabotage their actions in a sneaky way? Then this is the perfect option for you.\n\nADDICTIVE GAMEPLAY. \nIn each of the game's levels, you'll find a variety of options that will allow you to take down the bad guys, whether you do it Rambo-style or more tactically. Combine environmental effects and insane kills, or sneak up and kill them one by one. The goal is simple – dominate them all. \n\nNOSTALGIA IS KEY: \nImmerse yourself in 11 unique, beautifully hand-crafted levels inspired by Latin American aesthetics, classic retro games, and critically-acclaimed VHS action flicks.\n\nRETRO! \nEnjoy a uniquely composed soundtrack that fuses authentic mariachi, rock, and synthwave, explore artist-inspired graphic novels to engage more deeply with the story, and solve every puzzle as you connect all the dots in this thrilling desperado odyssey.",
