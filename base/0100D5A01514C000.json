Figuring out the patterns of blocks will make it easier to solve the puzzles.\n\nAs you progress solving the challenges, see your farm expand and evolve in the background with new types of vegetables.\n\nWith clean skies, fresh air, and crystal clear water, among birds and listening to the sounds of nature.",
