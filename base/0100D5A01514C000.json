    "description": "A country life, growing a vegetable garden in your own ranch. In this tiny fantasy countryside experience, that is easy to do and very relaxing.\n\nJust keep in mind: water brings life. Swap the blocks of earth, stone, water, and others, like water channels and lawn sprinklers, so that all the arable soil receives the necessary water. Solve the challenge and feel the pleasure of watching the plants instantly grow and bear fruit.\n\nThere is no time limit or resources to manage, so you can calmly just focus on the core mechanics while listening to a soothing soundtrack and animal sounds. Figuring out the patterns of blocks will make it easier to solve the puzzles.\n\nAs you progress solving the challenges, see your farm expand and evolve in the background with new types of vegetables.\n\nWith clean skies, fresh air, and crystal clear water, among birds and listening to the sounds of nature.",
