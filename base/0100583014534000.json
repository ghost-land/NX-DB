    "description": "Koh-Lanta is a challenging game that will put players' skills under pressure: life on an island is no walk in the park, and each day will bring its own surprises. Will you be the last adventurer?\n\nManage your daily life on the camp, have success in solo and team trials… and keep up the good relationships with the other survivors until the end to be the last one standing! \n\nBut be careful: if your body or morale gets exhausted, or if your fellow survivors vote for you on a council night… game is over!\n\n\nOver 10 challenging trials directly inspired from the TV show and over 10 survival mini-games to live the ”real” Koh-Lanta experience\n\nSURVIVE: gather resources to feed, build and improve your shelter to rest between trials and protect your physical and mental conditions\n\nPERFORM WELL: be the best and win trials to earn immunity for tribe councils and protect from being eliminated by other survivors\n\nOUTSMART THE OTHERS: form the right alliances with the right people, find the good words and act with diplomacy to be safe during councils and not be voted out\n\nA focus on social relationships with other survivors: follow the evolution of the relationships between survivors to know who hates who and choose the right side\n\nA colored and dynamic artistic direction is waiting for you in this game full of life: you don’t need to face trials every day, you can also walk on the island, go on a coconut run or fish…",
