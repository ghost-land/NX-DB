    "description": "The humorous strips follow the story of two warriors that do everything they can to defend their beloved castle of Mirmilovo from attacks by the evil order of Knaveknights. \n\nKayko is the clever, resourceful and lovable kind of a hero, while Kokosh is more of a strong and confident type, who’s always hungry. They both serve castellan and his wife—Mirmil and Lubava—who take care of general order in Mirmilovo.\n\nIn this beautiful, yet rarely quiet place the sneaky attacks from the Knaveknights are so common that Kayko and Kokosh need to constantly invent new tactics of saving the castle. And they do it in the most funny and cunning ways possible: from absurd diplomatic disputes through changing the opening hours of the castle to the fight with overwhelming spirit of laziness.\n\nThe additional ten comic strips picture everyday life in castle and its surroundings, with cute and magical creatures that live there.\nThanks to the fun drawings and stories the “Kayko & Kokosh Coloring Book” should please readers of every age and improve their mood immediately!\n\nKey features:\n\n—  Unique aesthetic\n—  Dozens of drawings to complete\n— Great fun for children - and an excellent way to introduce them to comics.\n— Best way for children to express their creativity",
