    "description": "It once was a place of your childhood happiness. None of that exists anymore. The question remains - why? What happened here? Where did all that beauty go, and what has taken it away?\n\nInteract with the environment, Penumbra / Amnesia style - drag, drop, throw items around. \nCollect as much loot as possible. Explore the forest and the remains of once inhabited buildings.\nKeep your heat up - it's freezing out there. Stay inside, or sit by the campfire to avoid hypothermia.\nCryptids - they roam the forest for the lookout of any survivors. Be careful out there.",
