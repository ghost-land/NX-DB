    "description": "The critically-acclaimed puzzle game produced by legendary creator Tetsuya Mizuguchi arrives on the Nintendo Switch™ console! An HD remaster of the original game, LUMINES REMASTERED beautifully marries the elements of sound, light and puzzle-action into one addictive, yet easy-to-play game. \n\nYou’re at the center of the high-energy, block-dropping action while you groove to awesome house, trance and techno beats! Play LUMINES REMASTERED on-the-go in handheld mode or at home in TV mode and tabletop mode. \n\nFeel the sound: Play over 40 skins with electronic atmospheres from chill to upbeat. Shuffle skins (like a music playlist) as more are unlocked in a new Shuffle mode.\n\nFeel the challenge: Faster tempos means less time to make combos, but slower songs can mean uncleared stacks. You’ll get hooked.\n\nFeel the fun: Take the challenge to unlock all skins and avatars, play against friends in local VS 2-player mode, or climb the ranks to the top of the online leaderboards.\n\nFeel the vibration: Turn on Trance Vibration and sync up to four Joy-Con™ controllers to feel the bass across your body.",
