    "description": "Death is lonely. He has zero friends on his FaceTome account and no one to hang out with. So, in order to feel better he begins “Project Deadlings”. Death buys a factory where he can build his laboratory and begin training a massive army of zombie minions. \nAs the army of Deadlings grows, the mazes within the laboratory become deadlier, loaded with puzzles and death-defying traps. Each Deadling has its own unique abilities: Bonesack is agile – he can run and jump, Creep can climb on walls and ceilings, Lazybrain treads slowly but carefully, and Stencher ... well Stencher has gastric problems and can use his powerful gas clouds to fly. \nYou will have to combine all of these abilities to find your way in Death's Maze. \nCan you help Death to kill his boredom? Will you be able to navigate all 60+ levels available in Deadlings? Will you complete Project Deadlings, and successfully train all of your zombie minions? ",
