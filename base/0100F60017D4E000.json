    "description": "Choose from four classic fantasy classes, engage in a deep robust combat system, and play a variety of co-operative and competitive game modes with friends via local, online or both. Get rich, or die trying!\n\nDeep Robust Combat System\nWhether you're playing as the mighty Amazon, valiant Warrior, agile Rogue or eccentric Wizard (with his trusty elemental summon), each class possesses a breadth of powerful combo move sets. Parry, dodge, juggle then unleash destructive special moves to take the upper hand against ever mightier foes, bosses and even your friends.\n\nCustomisable Character Choices\nAlong with class choice, you will have to make on-the-fly decisions that alter your character skillset. Skill trees focusing on the aspects of Chaos, Order, Darkness and Life will grant you skill augmentations and special abilities, whilst a myriad of equipment drops ensure that every run feels unique with plenty of options.\n\nPvE & PvP Variety\nExplore a variety of thrilling environments in Adventure Mode as you tackle biomes and bosses in your search for runes to the Sky Fortress. Team up with friends and battle against wave after wave of enemies in the challenging Horde Mode or settle the grudge with arena-based team PvP or free for all.\n\nGreed is Eternal\nIn Bravery and Greed, you can permanently unlock awesome content and game-altering augmentations by levelling up with gold. Greedily grab coins and plunder chests, steal pockets of gold when reviving allies, or be the first to run and grab loot after an epic encounter, get rich or die trying!",
