Explore from the Mangrove Swamp to Hell itself! \n- Double the enemy types of the original, and a roster of eccentric new bosses!\n- Electro-Mexican soundtrack, and more gorgeous visuals thanks to a fancy new rendering engine!\n- Definitely no secret society of chickens that teaches you ancient chicken abilities!",
