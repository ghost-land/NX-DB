    "description": "A classic challenge modernized\nIn Gimmick! 2, you once again meet the green little yokai Yumetaro. Decades after his first adventure he now sets out on a new quest in a world packed with interesting challenges, dangerous enemies, and hidden treasures.\nThe game can be played in either an friendlier assisted mode, or if you’re up for a challenge play in the true-to-the-original “Gimmick!” mode! \nStar physics\nAs a yokai, Yumetaro has the ability to summon and throw a powerful star that not only bounces, but also keeps the momentum of his movement.\nThe Star can be used to activate switches, defend against enemies and even be ridden to get to those hard-to-reach places while exploring the secrets of the world.\nYou can discover treasure, find shortcuts or set speed records by mastering the star's bouncing physics. Experiment with it to unlock its full potential.\nThis is a game with true star power!\n\nA Legendary Soundtrack\nThe composer David Wise hardly needs any introduction. In his work on the Gimmick! 2 soundtrack, he has both written completely new melodies and remade old classics. The soundtrack was creatively directed by Pelle Cahndlerby and recorded live in Sweden together with Joel Bille.\n\nBlast from the past\nThe original Gimmick! game was released for the Famicom™ in 1992. It was localized and released in the West - but only in Scandinavia. This, combined with the fact that the game's physics and gameplay mechanics were far ahead of its time, made the game both fabled and beloved. With Gimmick! 2, however, there is no longer any doubt: this is a game that the whole world should have the chance to experience.\n",
