The Seven Towers all have their distinctive themes, and challenges, accordingly. You have to collect keys, avoid, disable, or survive traps, find secrets, perform high-stake jumps over deadly heights, slay various, tricky Mimics, and, most importantly, not lose your bearings to scale the towers.\n\nKey features:\n-- 7+2 cylindrical, truly \"2.5D\", carefully hand-made towering levels\n-- lore-rich secrets and an engaging main story\n-- precision platforming and fighting mechanics--you have to plan and execute your jumps and other actions carefully\n-- a handful of unique enemy types with variants and surprises\n-- 3 difficulty levels",
