    "description": "At a time when all the oceans have been polluted and the last SubOcto ocean advocacy group has collapsed. Only one member and one dream remained. To get out of the ocean floor and see the sunset. The dream was within reach because it was known where the submarine container sunk to the bottom of the ocean. Only 10 keys were missing to reach the goal. Soldier take matters into your own hands, clear all the platforms and get the 10 keys. The world is waiting for your success! ",
