Romantic relationships are born under the shadow of death, offering a human counterpoint to the brutality of everyday life.\n\nAs the group faces increasingly complicated situations, from deadly ambushes to moral dilemmas that question their own ethical limits, the question remains: Can they survive not only the zombies, but also the threats posed by other humans?\n\nDiscover it in this great graphic novel with more than 20,000 words.\n",
