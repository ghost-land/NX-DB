Then you came along. Together, you can get to the bottom of this…\n\nSometimes life tests us.

With your assistance, they can overcome their difficulties and stay human. The story is presented in a comic strip format.\n\n• A cute but scary story.\n• Find and combine objects.\n• Enjoy the music.\n• Help the dreamkeeper solve all the puzzles!",
