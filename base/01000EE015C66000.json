    "description": "The game is a unique combination of a first-person platformer and a light-hearted exploration game with an almost philosophical story-telling. It is highly stylized and surprises with breathtaking environments, a surreal world full of beauty and grace, and a couple of small environmental puzzles that blend perfectly into the peaceful yet stunning environments. \n\nWill you be able to make it back into heaven? \nFind it out.
