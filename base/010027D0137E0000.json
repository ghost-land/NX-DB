It's the dream collab that can fit in your hands!\n\n-Fearsome fighters from killer series such as KOF, SAMURAI SHODOWN, STREET FIGHTER, and DARKSTALKERS clash fists in an all-out 26-fighter brawl!\n\n-Choose from either Single, Tag, or Team-based fighting modes! Additionally, there are 3 different battle styles you can choose from!\n\n-What's a fighting game without Survival, Time Attack, and Mini Games to keep you busy in-between bouts? Collect points and unlock those hidden characters!\n\n-Of course, SNK VS CAPCOM: THE MATCH OF THE MILLENNIUM also takes advantage of the Nintendo Switch's Tabletop and Handheld modes!\nThat means you and a friend can duke it out wherever you want!\n\n*The manual included with the game is from the NEOGEO POCKET COLOR game, and as such may contain instructions different to that on the Nintendo Switch.\n*Modes other than VS that require DC/KOF LINK are not enabled.",
