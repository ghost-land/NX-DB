    "description": "Heroes are overrated! This bundle contains the following villainous games: \n\nNefarious: Step into the wily shoes of evil genius Crow in this 2D action-platformer. Wreak havoc across five different kingdoms! Stomp on heroes in iconic battles recreated with you as the boss! Unleash your inner megalomaniac!\n\nReverse Crawl: A fast-paced turn-based strategy RPG that lets you lead mobs of monster minions and back-from-the-grave goons into battle against the elite ‘heroes’ of the Red Queen. Includes a local PvP mode, created exclusively for Nintendo Switch™.\n\nUnderhero: In this RPG-platformer the chosen hero has failed, and an underling of the evil king (that’s you!) reluctantly takes his place. Use timing-based combat to defeat enemies and save the Chestnut Kingdom from your own evil boss, Mr Stitches!",
