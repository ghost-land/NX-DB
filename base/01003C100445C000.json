    "description": "CASTLE OF HEART, available exclusively for Nintendo Switch™, is a classic action platformer at the genre’s best… and most challenging, with plentiful of new twists on formula to experience. The players take control over a cursed knight, turned to stone by the evil sorcerer’s spell, but ready to prove that love and courage can conquer even the darkest magic.\n\nThe brave hero must travel all the way from the petrified village to the dark ruler’s castle, mastering 20 levels set in 4 distinct environments – full of enemies who require different strategies to face them successfully and sudden gameplay changes, which translate to exciting, dynamic action sequences. The selection of progressively more powerful additional weapons, from flaming grenades to powerful magical arsenal, as well as power-ups, will help him in his quest. But remember – the body of stone has its limits! It disintegrates permanently as the knight loses the energy, which he can supply only by defeating his enemies, and if the process reaches the critical level, he may lose one of his arms and the ability to wield additional weapons with it. \n\nCastle of Heart offers beautiful and detailed 3D graphics with changing landscape, weather conditions and rich backgrounds. The game’s aesthetics and bestiary are in equal parts inspired by the Slavic mythology – with some locations derived straight from famous, mystical locations in Poland, the developers’ home country – and the dark fantasy atmosphere of the best action platformer titles from the golden age of the genre. All of this makes Castle of Heart a perfect mix of classic influences and modern approach, utilizing the spectrum of Nintendo Switch™ features, which will enchant both fans of the genre and newcomers.",
