    "description": "Gluck is a short adventure game that takes place in a mining company. Convert ore into cash and survive life underground as you unravel the mystery of the mine's depths.\n\nStory:\nTo restore the water that once flowed freely in your village, you disguise yourself as a newbie miner and make your way into the mine's deepest reaches. However, a mine is a place fraught with danger. You must dig tunnels while relying on help from your fellow miners and overcome all challenges to restore the water.\n\nWork Regulations:\nMaster the pickaxe and conveyor belt to harvest ore, and wield the unwieldy one-of-a-kind metal electromagnetic towing device to sort your loot. The ore you sort correctly is yours to keep, but don't expect to become rich. You've got to purchase your own helmet batteries, tools, and food. \n\nStay safe...",
