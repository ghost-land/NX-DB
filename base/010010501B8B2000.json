After a long and arduous journey, fraught with danger and difficulty, you arrive at the shores of a lush land, untouched by humanity, and abundant in resources. \n\nBut you are not the first to set foot on this new island, there are others who are looking to thrive—and survive. Welcome to CATAN! \n  \nA board that comes to life \nSee each tile come to life as you grow your settlements and take over the board. Gather ore from towering mountains, collect wool from bustling pastures, or harvest lumber from thriving forests. No two games are the same, with variable boards each game will feel, look, and play different! \n \nPlay locally with family and friends\nYou can now play with up to 4 people locally! Using your smart phone, connect to the game to track your cards without your friends seeing what’s in your hand. \n \nGame Modes & Rewards \nCompete in intense multiplayer games as you put your strategies to the test against other Catanians from around the world with online cross-play, at home or on the go!
