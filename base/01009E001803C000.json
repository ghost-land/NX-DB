In Pretty Girls Speed, you’ll be pitted against a wide variety of dauntingly gorgeous challengers as you try to claim victory as quickly as possible. Play cards that sequentially to the ones on the table, or if you don’t have any to use, you’ll automatically have more dealt to you. Be the first to get rid of all your cards, and you win!\n\nPretty Girls Speed may be quick and intuitive, but it’s also a challenge that requires both skill and a little luck!
