    "description": "One day, a mysterious package reaches the hero, who is harried by daily life as an adult.\nInside the package was a pillow-shaped machine and a letter asking for help.\n\nUpon activating the pillow, the hero falls into a waking dream.\nForgotten memories from childhood...\nEven these were but the opening act of the miracle about to begin.\n\nAfter its release in 2015, Yumeiri received acclaim from game magazines, science fiction magazines, and mystery novel magazines.\n\nWith a very high difficulty, and it gave rise to not a few frustrated players.\nAt the same time, players who accepted its concept of \"taming luck\" were impressed as if personally reliving a dramatic life.\n\nFor the full-scale remake, all scenarios were rethought and some episodes were rewritten.\n\nWhile the original was available only in Japanese, the game has now been produced with a full-scale English version. Korean is supported as well.\n",
