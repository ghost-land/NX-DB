    "description": "The popular game development simulator which lets you replay gaming history and run your own game development company is finally on Nintendo Switch™. Optimized for both touchscreen and Joy-Con™, Game Dev Tycoon plays better than ever before.\n\nGame Dev Tycoon lets you experience game development history first-hand, from the passionate garage development of the 80s to the AAA studios of today. It’s up to you to hire the best team, create the best games and research the best tech to make your mark on the industry.\n\nCreate games your way: in Game Dev Tycoon, the decisions you make during development matter. Does your game need sharper gameplay, better sound or should you focus more on story and quests? You decide!\n\nGrow your company: once you have a few successful games under your belt you can move into your own office and forge a world-class development team. Hire staff, manage them and unlock exciting new development options. Create your own game engines, invent new technologies and much more.\n\nThink big: with a big fan base and a great team, you can build ever larger games and rake in the profit and praise. But bigger ambition brings new challenges and you will have to manage your team and money well for your company to be among the stars of the industry.\n\nPirate mode: becoming a successful game developer can be tough enough but for an even greater challenge, you can try the (optional) pirate mode in which rampant game piracy makes pleasing your fans while fighting piracy to remain profitable a true balancing act.\n\nCross-platform saves: already a game dev tycoon on other platforms? No problem! Our new cross-platform save feature means you can import your existing game and play wherever it is most convenient for you.",
