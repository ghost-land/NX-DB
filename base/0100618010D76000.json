    "description": "Shacked up in an empty house in the Firsttown suburbs, our hero has a thing for taking down monsters. Talk to the townspeople to expand your field of exploration and freely traverse the land as you like.\nHowever you want to proceed, and however you want to take the monsters down is all up to you. Defeat the bosses awaiting you in each region and rack up the achievements for a little something special... The roster of lethal monsters include such superstars as the pervy \"Rockit\", who'll melt the threads of your clothes in all the right places.\nand \"Dryad\", who attacks by wrapping you up in her legs. Together with \"Sukumizu\", your random guidance-dispensing partner in adventure, make your way through a variety of dungeons in this wiggly, weird dot-style 1/4-view world.\n\nFeatures:\n・The main character is basically an unemployed hobo. You can select their gender.\n・All kinds of weapons are at your disposal: swords, axes, claws, staves, and bows & arrows. They also break down for like, no reason.\nSomehow make do with the crappy weapons and tools of your choice and use them to take down your enemies.\n・Take your pick from a wide variety of \"swimwear\", including swimwear actually used for swimming, swimwear that's just for show, etc.\n・Most of the monsters are soft, cute, sadistic girls.\n",
