You'll see some of her more vulnerable moments and have no choice but to intervene from time to time, but it's all to guide her toward a bright future!\n\nGive her direction while she's at home and help her grow her parameters in all kinds of ways. Your guidance will determine the future she ultimately heads toward. There are 20 total paths awaiting Sachi, and it's up to you to help her find them!",
