    "description": "When a powerful and sinister wizard named Malzer steals the hearts of the Torinto kingdom’s people, hope remains in the hands of those few heroes whose bonds are strong enough to protect them from the dark sorcery. Together they must turn the tide, defeat Malzer and return the kingdom’s inhabitants to their normal, peaceful existence, but the road ahead will be filled with peril!\n\nTORINTO is a run ‘n’ gun game with a medieval twist. Blades take the place of bullets as the heroes traverse side-scrolling stages, from forests and fields to castle walls, quelling the heartless fiends that now roam the land. Watch for enemy projectiles like axes and hurled boulders, leap across scaffolds and over spiky pitfalls, run headlong into danger and come out victorious. But you don’t have to do it alone! Like many genre classics, TORINTO can be enjoyed solo or with a friend in simultaneous cooperative play!\n\nFeatures:\n\nExperience a medieval fantasy twist on the classic run ‘n’ gun genre!\nTraverse side-scrolling stages with light platforming and frantic combat.\nRun, jump and throw blades as enemies close in from both sides!\nAdventure solo or team up with a friend in local co-op.\nEnjoy detailed pixel art and fluid animations!",
