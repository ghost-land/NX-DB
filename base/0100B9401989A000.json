    "description": "Your mission is simple: place tents next to trees in a nature-filled grid. The numbers around the grid tell you how many tents must be placed in each row and column, but be careful: tents can’t touch each other. Each level has only one unique solution, so take your time and carefully plan your every move.\n\n- As you progress through the game, you’ll encounter larger grids and more challenging levels that will require you to come up with your own strategies.\n- With a variety of music tracks and themes to unlock, including dark mode, you can personalize your gameplay experience even further.\n- Invite your camping buddies to join the fun in the local multiplayer mode, where up to 4 players can work together to solve puzzles.\n- With new daily levels to keep things fresh, the fun never ends.\n\nGet ready to pitch your tent and take on the challenge! Happy camping!",
