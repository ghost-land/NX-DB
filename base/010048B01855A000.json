    "description": "Legend has it that the three rays of light in the sky are emitted by a prism that grants happiness to the one who obtains it. You never believed in that, but it is your last resort...\nYou do not keep any recollection of the things you were able to do before, but you will be able to recall them through observation and to do them again. For example, you can jump after watching a monkey doing so or swing a sword after watching someone using it during a fight.\n\n\n-You can play in a peaceful and respectful way or choose a violent and destructive path. Innocence Island will evolve according to your choices.\n\n-Watch the people and animals around you to regain some abilities such as fishing, forging or even combat techniques from your opponents.\n\n-Solve puzzles, help the inhabitants and unlock past memories.\n\n-Traverse a beautiful island comprised inside a sphere by foot or harness the power of the Spell Statues and ride animalsâ€™ spirits!\n\n-You can play Innocence Island with different art styles; apart from the default Low-poly style, you can also select Oil Painting or Chunky Pixels!",
