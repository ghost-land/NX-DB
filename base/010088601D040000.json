    "description": "Character sprites and CGs are made using the E-mote animation system.\nWhen they breathe, wink, or speak, it all looks very realistic.\nEach character’s lines are fully dubbed in Japanese.\n\nDoes liking someone really make you happy? I disagree. \nWe might just enjoy the feeling of liking someone.\n\nI live in a serene and peaceful little village.\nThere are no wars, and everything here is very pleasant, just like heaven or a utopia. In this perfect world, we meet and get to know each other. People's emotions constantly intersect.\n\nWhy exactly do we live?
