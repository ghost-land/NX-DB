    "description": "Eight-Minute Empire, by Ryan Laukat, is a quick Civilization/Exploration game using card-driven area control.\n\nIn Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from the six displayed. This card gives the player a resource, and also has an action which the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents.\n\n• Recruit troops to strengthen your army\n• Command your forces to acquire new provinces\n• Challenge your friends all over the world\n• Sail across the seas & build castles to expand your empire\n• Eliminate enemy troops to weaken your adversaries\n• Collect goods to increase your advantage[/list]\n\nAWARDS & HONORS\nOur digital adaptation: \n\n• 2017 Golden Geek Best Board Game App Nominee\n• 2017 Golden Geek Best Mobile/Handheld Nominee\n\nThe board game: \n• 2013 Golden Geek Best Family Board Game Nominee\n• 2013 Golden Geek Best Print & Play Board Game Nominee\n• 2014 Gioco dell’Anno Nominee\n• 2014 Hra roku Nominee\n\nEight-Minute Empire: Complete Edition features all additional content released to date: \n• Eight-Minute Empire base game\n• Mountains Expansion\n• Old Europe Map\n• Archipelago of Azra Map\n• Southern Plains Map\n• Starfall Crater Map\n• Isthmus of Gom Map\n\nFeatures:\n• official Eight-Minute Empire game\n• great artwork\n• ingame interactive tutorial\n• languages: English, German, Dutch, Polish, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean, Japanese, Chinese Traditional and Simplified, Russian\n• play with AI, with friends or both\n• pass and play mode\n• online cross platform multiplayer with synchronous and asynchronous modes\n• opponents' last moves replay\n• 3 levels of difficulty AIs with individual strategies\n• different maps\n• ambient sounds and music\n• official rules plus extra additions\n• unique, original board game feel on your Nintendo Switch™\n• colorblind mode\n• over 70 achievements",
