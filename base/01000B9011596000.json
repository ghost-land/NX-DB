    "description": "Help Cole take revenge on the AI program named \"Scout\" and the company that put him out of a job. Solve puzzles, hack accounts, and stop the field of cybersecurity from being taken over by an evolving AI system. What starts as a simple act of revenge soon grows into something Cole can no longer walk away from.\n\nPuzzles involve rapidly linking chains of numbers to bypass security measures and steal money a little at a time. As the AI \"Scout\" learns more tricks, you'll soon unlock some of your own to fight back with. Featuring a fully voice-acted story and a fast-paced puzzle mechanic,  Chained will challenge your dexterity and assumption of what vengeance can cost.",
