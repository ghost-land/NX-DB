To find them, the duo must visit the places they spent time in, dive inside the memories of the people who knew them best, and learn the stories of their lives. \n\nTo help with their mission, Morris uses his newfound power that allows him to peer inside objects and people to reveal their contents and memories, like a supernatural X-Ray!\n\nAlong the way you will discover many stories about the history and folklore of Shelmerston, and its cast of curious inhabitants and visitors: tourist finches, the fishfolk, morlos, and the Legend of Aggi - the one who originally silenced the volcano...\n",
