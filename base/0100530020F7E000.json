    "description": "Everyone wants to eat you! Open the refrigerator door and run away. Avoid obstacles so you don't lose speed. \nJump over stools, slip under chairs and run onto tables.   \nRemember that a very hungry person is running after you and you can't stop. \nCollect coins and choose fun skins for each new run. Make big jumps, take sharp turns and find shortcuts. The main thing is not to stop and run! ",
