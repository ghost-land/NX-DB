    "description": "You follow the story of Jack - a mosquito bounty hunter, on his path of revenge. Soon however, he finds himself neck-deep in a vicious scheme that is far more than he bargained for. Heavily outgunned and outnumbered, Jack will need help from a few rather unusual allies to even the odds. In the land with no laws, from deserted anthills and dusty mines, through badland battlefields to treacherous swamps, he's on a hunt for the Calaveras gang. And they are wanted alive...or dead.\n\n- Epic adventure of blood and revenge, featuring guns, explosives, trains and insects (with even more guns!)\n\n- With a narrator, accompanying you through the story (voiced by Tim Simmons)\n\n- Jack is voiced by legendary Elias Toufexis (Adam Jensen from DeusEx)\n\n- Outstanding cast of more than 15 fully voiced and rather peculiar characters\n\n- Fully hand drawn visuals in a distinct comic book style\n\n- Beautiful acoustic soundtrack that pays tribute to the old classics of the genre",
