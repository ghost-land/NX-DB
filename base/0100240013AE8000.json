    "description": "Several years after Yuuji Kazami and his friends fought for their lives in a fierce battle, a new generation of heroines gather at Mihama Academy, which has been reinstated as a 'specialist training school'.\nTaking place in the same world as The Fruit of Grisaia, new characters bring an exciting fresh take in Volume 6 of this brand new series!\nThis thrilling story, which unfolds at the reborn Mihama Academy, will undoubtedly excite not only those who have played previous releases, but those who are new to the series as well!\n\nAvailable in three languages!\nThe text can be set to Japanese, English or Simplified Chinese (audio is Japanese only). This includes in-game text, options, and the digital manual. Language settings can be changed at any time.\n\nPlay using only the touch screen! Play with one hand!\nPlay in handheld mode with the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con™ controllers attached, or detach them and play with just the touch controls!

(A separate Joy-Con (R) is required to play with one hand.)\n\nVolume 6 Summary\nIt's the day that comes around once a year—a day when Haruto and the other members of a previous generation of Phantom Triggers make their way to a mountain summit. Atop that mountain lies Haruto's master—Aoi.\nOn the way, they reminisce about the life of Aoi, a young woman so vicious, and yet so pure.\nAs they do so, the secrets behind the reborn Mihama Academy begin to spill forth.\n\"All matter eventually breaks down, and every living thing eventually dies. Entropy. That's all there is to it.\"\nJust what events led to Aoi's final moments in this world...?\n\nGameplay\nIt's a visual novel in which you don't need to make any choices, so you can enjoy the story like you would when watching a movie or reading a book. The story comes to life with a star-studded voice actor cast and fully-voiced story (excluding the main character), gorgeous graphics and music, and immersive animation.\n\nStaff\nCharacter Design/Art: Akio Watanabe\nStory: Ryuta Fujisaki\nSD Character Design/Art: nanaca mai\n\nCast\nAoi            VA: Ami Koshimizu\nRena            VA: Maaya Uchida\nTohka          VA: Ayane Sakura\nChris            VA: Kaori Nazuka\nMurasaki      VA: Atsumi Tanezaki\nMaki            VA: Yoshino Nanjo\nGumi           VA: Suzuko Mimori\nTaiga           VA: Natsumi Takamori\nYuuki           VA: Mikoi Sasaki\nMiss Arisaka VA: Mikako Izawa\nEnishi          VA: Kenji Hamada\nKuroe          VA: Ai Kakuma\nOther\n*Fully voiced (excluding the main character)",
