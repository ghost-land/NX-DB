Atop that mountain lies Haruto's master—Aoi.\nOn the way, they reminisce about the life of Aoi, a young woman so vicious, and yet so pure.\nAs they do so, the secrets behind the reborn Mihama Academy begin to spill forth.\n\"All matter eventually breaks down, and every living thing eventually dies. Entropy. That's all there is to it.\"\nJust what events led to Aoi's final moments in this world...?\n\nGameplay\nIt's a visual novel in which you don't need to make any choices, so you can enjoy the story like you would when watching a movie or reading a book.
