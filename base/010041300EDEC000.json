    "description": "A fun based sports game, which will have you standing up, moving around and literally re-enacting the movement of the game you’re playing.\n\nUsing your Joy-Con™, you can carve your way through the competition and ‘slap shot’ your way to victory.\n\nSteer your team to triumph in the Knockout Cup, enter Exhibition Mode to get straight into the action or you can also go head to head with your friends in the local multiplayer mode. The choice is yours!\n\nPull off some awesome super skill moves by utilising the special Joy-Con™ gestures. Learn chip shot, the power shot and the charge shot to send the puck blazing past the goalie and into the back of the net.\n\nFace off with you opponents and deliver a devastating slapshot. Can you take control of the puck and take your team to the top of the league? ",
