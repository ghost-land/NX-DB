The choice is yours!\n\nPull off some awesome super skill moves by utilising the special Joy-Con™ gestures. Learn chip shot, the power shot and the charge shot to send the puck blazing past the goalie and into the back of the net.\n\nFace off with you opponents and deliver a devastating slapshot. Can you take control of the puck and take your team to the top of the league? ",
