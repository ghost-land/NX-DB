    "description": "You didn't imagine that Muhammad Ali could punch Nikola Tesla, did you? Or Queen Semiramis defying Jeanne d'Arc. INVOCATION provides you with the arena that will allow all this to happen. Designed as a mini MOBA, this game allows hours to pass, whether you are playing with your friends gathered by 4 people or while you are alone against AI. So don't look at it being mini, it's pretty average..\nEnter the world of INVOCATION with 2 different game modes, 2 different maps and 4 different characters you want to take on and their unique skills!",
