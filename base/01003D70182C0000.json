He’s a ‘go-to’ guy in his hometown of Grey Ville. Research conducted in the nearby military base gives the town a mysterious aura. Residents prefer to stay away from it. Things take an unexpected turn when one of the experiments goes horribly wrong and the area is quarantined. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman chases a fugitive…\n\n• PERSEVERANCE: PART 2\nPlay as Karen, a calculated assassin on the hunt for a mysterious girl in the remote town of Grey Ville. As you inch closer to finding your target, you will become more and more entangled in the social network of the tight-knit small-town community and uncover the secrets held close to the chest by the locals. What started out as a simple ‘locate and retrieve’ will soon turn into a nightmare Karen cannot escape.\n\n• PERSEVERANCE: PART 3\nIn Part 3 you can choose whether to play as Jack or Karen. In this final episode of the series, the only thing juicier than the gossip are the guts being spilled left and right. During your playthrough, you’ll have over 200 decisions to make and they will all influence how the plot progresses, so choose wisely. Will you help save humanity from the zombie outbreak or will you take the selfish path and save yourself and those dearest to you? No choice is a wrong choice but think through each and every step or you may just step off a cliff.",
