Wield the humanoid robot, \"Gears\" to take back the city!\n\nGears are enhanced through equipping a variety of over 460 parts.\n\nFind the perfect combination that suits your playstyle.\n\n―Story―\nThe GEAR System was developed sometime in the middle of the 21st century, by the Atsuga Corporation, and allowed pilots unprecedented motor-control and maneuverability with their machines. Mankind developed the system further, to create man-operated mechs and robots, known as GEARs.\n\nIn the year 2050, the world goes to war, in what would be known as World War IV. Nonetheless, the outcome, no one could have predicted...\n\nThe GEARs, which were the primary forces in battle became uncontrollable by their operators, and turned against mankind. GEARs that have gone berserk were named RAGEs, and left a mark on human history that can never be forgotten.\n\nIn 2097, the human population that remained was forced to live underground. And, in order to reclaim what they have lost to the RAGEs, they call upon the GEAR System once more.\n",
