    "description": "Gemini is an interactive poem and video game about two stars flying into the heavens together.\n\nIn Gemini, the player controls the movement of a star that has descended to the earth. Soon it comes across another starâ€”a little one with its own intentions and personality. Together, the two stars move in tandem to explore mythical spaces, share moments of joy, and overcome obstacles. Through the journey, the player comes to learn more about the little star and how to fly beautifully. After finishing the game once, the player unlocks a local two-player mode to share the experience with a family member, friend, or partner.\n\nThe story of Gemini is told wordlessly. It gives the player the freedom to determine the meaning of its metaphors through a playful exploration of its world and mechanics.\n\nFly high, journey far, and enjoy.\n\n\n- Original and expressive gameplay, where moving is like dancing\n- Absorbing narrative delivered wordlessly with stunning visuals\n- Abstract and dreamlike world immersed with haunting music\n- Designed for everyone, with simple and intuitive controls\n- Finish the single-player game to unlock innovative modes for two players",
