    "description": "A kingdom simulation game where you immigrate to an imaginary kingdom and enjoy a life of freedom.\nIt is your chance to visit a fantastical virtual kingdom that lets you travel wherever you wish to go... \nThrough beautiful woods, rivers, farms, pastures, mines, schools, churches, and castles. \nBut that's not all—the lives of the kingdom's residents are also simulated in fine detail.\n\nPlayers who visit the kingdom will feel as if they are playing an MMORPG as they engage in authentic conversations with its inhabitants.\nThey'll be able to find a boyfriend or girlfriend, get married, and have children... And even those children can have children of their own.\nThe lives that players lead in this kingdom are unique to them and will be totally different with every playthrough. \nThis is so much more than a typical game—it is an experience that will stay in your heart as a cherished memory forever.\n",
