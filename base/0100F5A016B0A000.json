    "description": "Forget running or jumping. In Explosive Candy World, you’ll have to destroy obstacles, blow yourself over pitfalls and ricochet off walls in order to reach the goal! It’s physics-based mayhem with a precision platforming twist. Presented in cute and colorful pixel art and set to an original retro soundtrack, Explosive Candy World mixes classic style with modernized mechanics for a unique and unconventional platforming experience.\n\nAdjust the strength and direction of your detonations, then release to toss a mighty explosive candy. Propel yourself through the air, flip switches, break barriers, activate buttons and obliterate platforms right from under your feet! Levels are all short and sweet, and even when they prove to be a little tricky, quick respawns and infinite retries keep the experience fun and accessible.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Use explosive candy to destroy obstacles or propel your own body!\n• Take on 80 single-screen physics challenges across more than 4 worlds.\n• Jump straight into gameplay with zero text or menus!\n• Enjoy cute pixel art presentation reminiscent of 4-tone classics.\n• Retry stages as many times as it takes with instant respawns!\n",
