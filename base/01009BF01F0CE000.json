    "description": "Every level has a unique layout of cubes and spheres with different kinds of colors. All cubes get attracted to the ball you are controlling. You have to avoid the colored ones (red, blue, etc) and collect the white ones.\n       After clearing a level the total of cubes gets counted and the collected cubes can be spent to give your ball a different look. The game contains a couple of achievements, cloud save and gamepad controls are supported.\n      The game is not hard but more in between easy and normal. It's meant to relax instead of being too challenging. The background music will reflect the easy-going vibe of the game.",
