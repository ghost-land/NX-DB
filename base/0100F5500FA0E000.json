    "description": "Countless heroes have tried and failed to destroy the ancient spell that holds the castle walls. Meanwhile, hundreds of monsters are roaming inside, guarding the sword shards — the last known thing to be capable of defeating the demonic castle owner, thus shattering its magical structure.\n\nAlthough you are not alone — some help could be obtained from the merchants, who, for reasons not truly understood, offer their services right inside the lair of evil. Though, it seems to be only a matter of time for them to disappear...\n\nPlan your every step carefully, because save points aren't a thing in a rogue-lite game! There is, however, another option. There are two difficulty modes: PAL/NTSC. If the game feels too unforgiving, you can tone down the difficulty, lowering the framerate to 50 (PAL). Note, though, that music and sounds become more evil at the 83% of their original pitch.\n\nJust like in old NES™ games, you need to input 13 characters to get back to your game session. Still, the powers of evil prevent you from saving anything much more than the artefacts you've found…\n\nFeatures: \n\n- Pixel art style graphics inspired by the 8-bit era of gaming.\n- Various playable characters with different game styles and more to unlock. \n- Randomly generated castle,  216 rooms to overcome. \n- Old school password system and two difficulty modes that come from retro gaming.\n",
