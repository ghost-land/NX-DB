    "description": "In Metaverse Keeper you explore randomly-generated worlds, customize your weapons and fight crazy monsters – in solo or co-op mode!\n\nFive unique heroes, each with their own special skills, have been called upon by the mysterious government of the Metaverse.\n\nLong ago, a great cataclysm shook reality and created the Metaverse and its Bastion – a vast and mysterious ship drifting across space-time. Our heroes will board the Bastion with one goal in mind: uncover the secrets behind the cataclysm, stop the Boss, and bring balance back to the Metaverse.\n\nHarness the power of space-time abilities - death becomes a minor setback as our heroes will return again and again until this great evil is defeated. But death has a cost; the chaotic nature of the Metaverse will change the very Bastion itself, and no two attempts will ever be the same.\n\nWith so many weapons, enemies and environments to discover, the quest to save the Metaverse is better than ever on Nintendo Switch™!",
