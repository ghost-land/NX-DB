Machines have adopted the shape and form of marine animals.\nThe ocean is full of creature-machine hybrid monsters. You are a “Hunter” and the new journey begins...\n\nEarth Atlantis is a side-scrolling shooter with an original \"Monster-Hunting\" gameplay. Search and hunt down dreadful sea monsters and explore the post-apocalyptic underwater world. Unlock multiple ships with special weapons and abilities for your journey and become a legendary hunter! \n\nThe game is presented in a very unique and artistic “Old Sketching” visual style, which expresses the essence of the 14th century’s ocean exploration when the sea was considered a dangerous place full of monsters.",
