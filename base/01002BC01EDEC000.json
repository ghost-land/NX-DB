Your role here will be to take care of the hotel and attend to guests and all their needs for the duration of their stay.\n\n\nCLEAN, PREPARE, AND SERVE - SERVICE, I MEAN SERVICE \nBefore the guests arrive you’ll need to tidy up and prepare their rooms. Look at your to-do list, take all the necessary equipment from the trolley and get rid of the mess. To answer incoming questions: yes, the guests will complain if they see but a crumb on their carpet.\n\nTime is money.
