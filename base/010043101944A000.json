    "description": "In a world where battles over Energi, the life energy have broken out, a young man with no memory meets a princess whose kingdom has been destroyed.\nThe gears of fate begin to move little by little in this truly classic fantasy story... Cut a way through the path of despair with allies!\n\nUse up to three styles for each character in turn-based battles to get benefits from recovery to fighting styles. Increase Energi levels by raising multiple elementals unique to the Alphadia series and learn new skills. The combo skill called Resonant Skill is also the key to victory.\n\nAlphadia Neo also features an original fishing system where you can fish in various points to get fish exchangeable with powerful items or equipment!",
