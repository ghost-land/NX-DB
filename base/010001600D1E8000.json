The Nintendo Switch allows Cube Creator X to stretch its legs and accommodate much larger worlds which feel vast and alive (more than three times the total cubes in DX). ARC Systems’ incredible history of brilliant art direction is evident in a massive cosmetic upgrade in character and level design. Multiplayer is supported for Competitive and Cooperative styles of play up to four players.\n\nIn Cube Creator X, players can choose Creative Mode to create their masterpiece worlds. Robust editing tools can be utilized to help unleash player’s creativity more efficiently. In Adventure Mode, players will embark on various quests and fight epic battles. Players create shelters, and even fortresses and cities. Many new items have been added, including weapons, architecture, and agriculture cubes. Half-cubes have also been added, along with the ability for the main character to experience hot & cold, as well as the ability to grow in size after consuming food items. \n\nThe Stages Mode allows players to create stage levels with a jumping-off point and a goal to be accomplished. Players can add movement blocks, monsters, treasure chests, along with many more new, unique cubes. The players’ stages can be uploaded to the Cube Creator X community (the Plaza) to be shared with anyone looking for their next challenging stage to conquer.\nCube Creator X is ready for you to create wonders and advance through epic quests.
