    "description": "Holy Great Martyr Theodore the Tyro (or Theodore the Recruit) lived in the early 300s. This Synaxarion will step through his story as it is known today. It is a visual novel that will allow you to experience the story of Saint Theodore in a graphical setting. As you progress through the story, you will come across different levels to explore to collect holy items and lost treasures.\n\nThe Synaxarion is a collection of Saintsâ€™ lives, which are celebrated each day of the year. They are a light that leads us to Christ in every generation, a living Gospel. The ministry and very life of Christ is worked out in the lives of the Saints, His faithful servants. They are the glory of the Church, the God-bearers on earth and in heaven. Most of the saints were unknown to the world, but the Grace of God made them known to the whole universe and to all the ages. Amen.",
