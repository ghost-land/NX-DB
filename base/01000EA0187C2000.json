If you want answers, you’ll have to venture deep into the darkness of Crow Country to find them…\n\nA survival horror game, where you’ll test yourself against puzzles and riddles as you investigate the eerie tranquility of the abandoned theme park. Don’t be deceived by the whimsical surroundings, something is awfully wrong in Crow Country.\n\nAs you unlock new areas, backtrack and discover more, you gradually piece together why Edward really shut down his park and where he mysteriously disappeared to. You’ve heard some pretty disturbing rumors, but they couldn’t possibly be true…..right? \n\nFor visitors to the park who are more interested in spotting crows and taking in the sights, Exploration Mode allows you to journey on without the fear of being attacked by the mysterious monsters roaming Crow Country. Besides, if you knew what those monsters really are…..\n\nJust how far would someone go to follow their ambition? Are some sins too wicked for redemption? \n\nA tale of reckless hubris and human greed, and now at the center of it all... you. \n\nWho are you really, Mara Forest? ",
