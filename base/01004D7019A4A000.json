    "description": "Cities are usually concrete jungles, noisy and stressful.\nBut you can also entertain yourself by looking at how they are organized, finding interesting details, and seeing life unfold. Then you can see that they are also vibrant and full of life.\n\nHere, the cities are set up on islands over calm and clear water.\nIn this tiny fantasy building experience, it is easy to do and very relaxing, just like a 3D jigsaw puzzle.\n\nCarefully observe the island, try to memorize it, then shuffle the blocks. Swap blocks to reproduce the desired island and the city will emerge.\n\nThere is no time limit, logic challenges, or resources to manage, so you can calmly focus on the core mechanics while listening to a soothing soundtrack.\n\n- Click on two blocks to swap them;\n- Turn the camera freely around the island;\n- Move the camera as you wish;\n- Zoom in and out to see details or the big picture;\n- If you need, preview the expected arrangement.\n- 20+ diorama-like islands.\n\nSee your island come to life as you complete certain sectors.",
