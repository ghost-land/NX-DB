Keep your animals stimulated and entertained. You can be sure they'll be starved for attention!\n\nExtend\nAs you succeed in your efforts, you will be faced with additional challenges. Make sure to turn them into opportunities as you invest in your facilities and expand according to your growing needs.\n\nBe careful\nAnimals need a level head just as much as they need a loving heart.
