    "description": "Poetic, surrealistic and melancholic, EMMA: Lost in Memories offers a unique experience in a strange and dangerous world where walls fade away as you touch them.\n\nThe main character, Emma, is young, vibrant and intriguing: she leaves her home following an owl, and soon loses herself in a world which she slowly finds more and more dangerous.\n\nFeatures:\n- One fast and simple mechanic: all the platforms and walls start disappearing when you touch them!\n- The character runs automatically at a fixed speed! Control her special abilities (double jump, dash and climb) and do your best to react at the correct time.\n- Minimalistic 2D artistic style completely drawn by hand.\n- Dynamic gameplay in a poetic and eccentric world.\n- Single-screen levels which combine skill and ingenuity with planification and strategy.\n- Two game modes: Main Story and Memory Chest. Complete the Main Story first to enjoy the levels in the Memory Chest!\n- Delicate reflexion on memory loss.",
