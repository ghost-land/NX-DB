    "description": "What would you do if you were a bubble and had to gather as many stars as possible? But in this adventure, it won’t be that simple. You’ll need to pass through thorns, saws, lasers, obstacles, and you might even get electrocuted by a high-voltage current. Oh, don’t forget that doors need keys. Will you be able to overcome all these challenges?",
