You even have a Ferris wheel to touch the stars! Nothing stands between you and this secluded paradise, only an unsettling feeling in the back of your mind that something is going wrong. At some point, it all dramatically changes and now you have to find out what this world really conceals…\nFeatures:\nYou are about to get on a journey around small planet-like worlds as if you were in the Little Prince's world. However, these ones are filled with monsters that are striving to kill you, deadly traps and riddles, which require you to be quick-witted and attentive.\nPlunge into the quaint and atmospheric world of a dark tale and reach its core to find out what hides in the haze.\n\nThe indie-platformer World of One has many levels and puzzles with multiple solutions, big boss fights, hostile creatures, and 4 different endings, which depends on the actions you take throughout the course of the game. Only your determination will help you complete your journey and find the truth about yourself.\n\nBeware, World of One will challenge your mind and skills. Moreover, completion of the game unlocks the \"New game+\" mode, which gives you only 3 lives. Will you accept this challenge?\n",
