    "description": "Being dead is not so bad when you have the Underworld to live in. A magical and expansive world inhabited by quirky, charming and sometimes deadly inhabitants of the afterlife, the Underworld also includes Aftervale. Aftervale is a happy hub where the dead spend eternity and begin to come to terms with their time alive through a Remembrance. \n\nFor our hero Skully, Remembrance day comes crashing down as humans invade from the kingdom above. Instead of raiding the Underworld for treasures, they kidnap the Aftervale's elder skeleton Elzedon and then go after the very magic that kindles the spirits of the dead, the Blue Flame. Without the Blue Flame, there is no Aftervale nor existence beyond death.\n\nJump, slash and flap your way through the Underworld together with your best bat friend Imber! It's up to you to stop the human invasion, save the Elder, protect the Blue Flame and confront Skully's past life.\n\nFeatures:\nVersatile and fluid platforming.\nDeadly charming art style\nBe a warrior AND a skeleton.\nFight the Humans before they plunder your un-life!\nMeet the unique cast of happy monsters and make friends along the way\nPlay as Imber the bat, your adorable best friend\nExplore at your leisure and look for secrets, or try to speed run\nFun for all skill levels and challenge seekers\nExtensive check point system of Blue Flames to practice your jumps!",
