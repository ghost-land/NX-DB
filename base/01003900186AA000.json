Now she needs to find a way back home - and also save her planet.\n \nIt was late evening and the museum was almost empty. At the Maya artifact exhibition, one of the exhibits suddenly started to move. The sound drew the attention of a young woman named Diana, a museum employee and an expert in Mayan culture.

Now Diana has to figure out where she is, how she got there and how she's going to return home.

And now the gates have been activated again...\n\nOnly Shaash, the local shaman and gate keeper, can help Diana return home. But that will not be easy. Diana will have to face numerous tests, travel far through the Endless River Valley, encountering the strange people and wondrous animals of the other world, while trying to hide from all dangers and solving dozens of different challenges on her way.\n\n- Multiple wonderful locations and stunning graphics\n- Unexpected plot turns\n- Unforgettable characters\n- Fascinating mini-games and puzzles",
