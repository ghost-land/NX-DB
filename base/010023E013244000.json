    "description": "“Escape from Life Inc” is a quirky story-driven puzzle platformer, where you switch between three animals: a walking fish, an arrogant eagle and a stuttering reindeer. Throughout your adventure you'll be doing puzzles, platforming, exploring and much more. Together with plenty of wacky characters, help these three unlikely friends escape the alien lab!\n\nFeatures:\n- Play as three animals with unique personalities and abilities\n- Discover a crazy and comedic narrative, with some dark twists...\n- Meet a charming cast of talking animals\n- Experience five different chapters that each switch up the gameplay drastically\n- Enjoy tons of fun puzzle and platforming mechanics\n- Bounce on a fat pig's stomach (Don't worry, they're fine with it)\n\nI'm a 15 year old solo developer from Sweden, and this is my passion project I've been working on for about 1.5 years. It's a very personal game, with almost every tiny detail having its own little story to tell. I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I've enjoyed creating it :)",
