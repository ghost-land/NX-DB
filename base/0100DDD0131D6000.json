    "description": "Why is Flowing Lights different from other shooting games?\nPuzzle elements! They offer a challenge for the brain on top of the immediate fun of destroying monsters. Deeper challenges, deeper sense of achievement!\n\nHow do these puzzle elements work?\nEach fight has been designed as a puzzle that requires a new tactic. Thanks to a unique system of terrain and physics, bullets flow like a liquid and create new and gripping gameplay situations. The goal is not only to destroy all enemies but also to find the right tactic to do so! This may require several attempts so Flowing Lights has been designed to facilitate experimentation. Failing and retrying is part of the game! Fights can be restarted instantly and without any penalty.\n\nTarget audience:\nFlowing Lights was designed to be easy to learn and difficult to master. It's a game for players who like a challenge. Each fight can be won with 4 levels of achievement: C, B, A and S. Ranks A and S can only be achieved by completing all Combos, which adds new challenges for the best players. However, the game is easily accessible with playable tutorials and training modes.\n\nFeatures:\n-Puzzle elements for a varied, always fresh experience\n-Retro Arcade gameplay: smooth, accurate, challenging\n-Unique physics based gameplay, gravity is the true 3rd dimension\n-200 fights created with love, each one unique and with optional challenges\n-Power Ups, Combos, Ranks and online leaderboards for more replayability",
