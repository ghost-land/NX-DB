    "description": "December 6th, 2158\n\nYou have been appointed as commander of a humanoid unit on a top secret mission: Resuce the survivors trapped in a Mars research facility that has gone dark, and return them to Earth.\n\n◆Real-time Battle Formations\nTake control of four humanoid units in a 3x3 grid during real-time battles. Makes split-second decisions as you command characters to fight, flee or execute your own stratagems on the battlefield. Strategic timing and firm decisiveness will be key to overcoming these trying conditions, all the while running against the clock!\n\n◆Character Customization\nGear up your humanoid squadron to tackle any situation. Depending on their combination of class, frame and equipment, each humanoid can be specialized to take on a variety of roles. Create a slow but deadly long-range sniper, a quick fighter, a devastating combat berserker, or a supportive healer, to name a few. Customize your humanoids as you see fit to create a powerful team!\n\n◆Battery Level\nDuring every run, you'll tread your through a path that forks off into multiple routes. Your humanoids require battery power to operate, battle enemies and investigate the research facility. As you proceed, your battery will slowly drain, no matter what it is you're doing. Draw on your knowledge and make tough choices - delve to the deepest level and aim for the boss, or retreat from combat to gather new items and equipment? Keep an eye on the battery level and gauge what approach would best suit your party.",
