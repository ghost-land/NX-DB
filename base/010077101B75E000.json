    "description": "Are you ready to test your memory? Then you will like this puzzle!\n\nThe game is very easy to learn - you need to take turns opening cards with pictures and try to remember the position of the same pictures. As soon as you open two identical pictures, they will disappear from the field. With each pair found, the game timer increases, but if you think too long, time will run out and the level will fail.\n\nThe game is simple, but with each level the number of cards and pictures will increase, so you will have to use your memory to find all the pairs before the time runs out! You can also customize backgrounds and pictures to your liking!\n\nGAME FEATURES:\n• Excellent training for memory;\n• 50 levels with different difficulty;\n• Customizing backgrounds and pictures;\n• Colorful graphics;\n• Management with the Joy-Con™️ controllers;\n• Relaxing musical accompaniment;",
