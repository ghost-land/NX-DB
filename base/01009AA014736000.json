    "description": "After a long war, you come back to your hometown. As a noble, you commanded a detachment of the army led by the king. As you approach your castle, you notice that something is wrong. As you get closer, you will notice that the castle has been occupied by orcs. Your two companions are killed before your eyes by the enemy orc on the castle walls. In a hurry, you go to the back of the castle, where you activate a secret passage known only to family members. You decide, as the heir of the head of the family, to take the castle from the hands of the wicked orcs.\n\nReturn of the Heir is an adventure-platform game set in a fantasy world. As a young heir, we travel through the nooks and crannies of our family castle in search of missing family members. Additionally, we are trying to recover the treasures stolen by the invaders. On our way there are hosts of orcs, sinister rats, spiders and various traps such as hidden spikes, falling orbs, gargoyles spitting fire or lava holes. Armed only with a bow, you must do whatever it takes to recapture the castle you will wield in the future.",
