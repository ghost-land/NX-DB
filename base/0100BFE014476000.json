Well, then you need to help Josie to beat the superhero training simulator, and to become the hero our world needs!\n\nIn this beautiful, hand-crafted precision platformer, you’ll play as Josie, aka. Sunblaze, with a mission to complete your superhero training. Your dad, a former superhero himself, built the training simulator dreaming of your journey to become a superhero. The simulator is full of puzzles, brain-tickling challenges, double jumps, dashes, spikes, drones... And a purrfect sidekick: the cat. You have got a cat. What else do you need?\n\nWell, skills. That’s what you need. Do you think you’ve got ’em? Dive into Sunblaze now, and be the hero... called Sunblaze.\n\nAll you need is a simple story\nThe story takes place inside a training simulator, where Josie is being trained to be a superhero by her father. There’s witty dialogue, embarrassing moments and of course the most important part of the family — the cat!\n\nSmooth and gameplay driven\nThere’s no need to take a boring pause as you complete a level in Sunblaze. The in-game simulator calculates and draws you the next level immediately as you complete one! It is a delight to look at, but remember to keep your head clear - the next level is about to start! And there are over 500 of them – that's right, over five hundred levels.",
