    "description": "Please welcome the sequel to everyone's (well, at least someone's) favorite game Princess.Loot.Pixel.Again! Lots of fun with no hint at being serious, randomly generated adventures. x2 means heaps more artifacts, objects, locations, enemies, bosses, secrets and booby traps! The game retains the original graphic style called \"pixel comic\" (at least, that's what the devs say anyway).\n\nPLPA x2 is full of amusing and bizarre events, easter eggs and references to other games and movies. You think you've seen it somewhere before? Then you must be right!\n\n• 3 unique characters, each with different features\n• Some good old 8-bit drum-n-bass O_o\n• More achievements! I SAID MOAR!!! Hm, well not too many, but you know what I mean.",
