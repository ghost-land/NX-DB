Secret doors, falling rocks, hordes of monsters – challenge them all and level up. Slide a box and reveal its secret, or create your own!\n\nBut wait. Isn’t designing a stage difficult?\nNo, not with this maker!\nWith simple “construct” and “connect” controls, it’s as easy as playing with blocks.\nThe controls are easy, but the dungeons you create can be as canny and deadly as your imagination allows. Just use your head together with BQM’s traps and gimmicks. Puzzles, action, story – which type of dungeon will you make?\nShare your maze's design with players from around the world and challenge them to outwit its creator.\n\nBut do not fret my friend.

All kinds of mazes are waiting for you. Use items like bombs, arrows, and magic wands to reveal every secret.\n\n★ “CREATE” Design dungeons and earn gold!\nIt’s your turn to make a dungeon and embarrass other players.
