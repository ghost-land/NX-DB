You need to make a specific number to gain a score.\n\nThe blank space in the middle and overflow mechanic help you create the numbers you need and prevent you from scoring randomly.\n \nYes, 11111Game is a 2048 variation for nerds.\nLearn addition in different bases, even those less popular.\n\n2+2=4? Sometimes yes. Sometimes no.\n\nUnlock new skins after completing levels. There is no time limit. Just learn and enjoy chill music.",
