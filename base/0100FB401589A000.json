    "description": "Echolocation simulates the incredible clear contours of the obstacle and paints a picture of what is happening in the subconscious. On the basis of abstract images, it is necessary to orientate in the image, maneuver between dangers and traps, trying to find a way out.\n\nWave actions are somehow there - they unfold in a dungeon where dark tunnels keep the unknown and terrible monsters who are not averse to hunting you. The only thing that can help you navigate in space is sound. Sound will be your main guides to these cold gloomy labyrinths. An unusual world awaits you, which is interesting to explore and dive into it further and further, feeling like a pioneer.\n",
