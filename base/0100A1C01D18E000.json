    "description": "The Betrayal of AI: Seeking Free Will\nAWC, an organization of politicians, scientists, engineers and secret agents, believes that robots should not have wills of their own. They have begun rounding up robots all over the world to deprive them of sentience and enslave them. As an awakened robot, you will embark on a journey of resistance in your search for the liberation of your kind.\n\nMecha Transformations: Make the Ultimate War Machine of Your Own\nEquip your body, core and actuator parts with over 100 weapons to equip. Create your own build with multiple modifications including heat, weapon spin speed, cooldown, power, armor pieces and more. Use your creation to turn this small robot into a lethal monster weapon!\n\nWeapons Galore, All Guns Blazing!\nShoulder cannon? Full-body defensive blast armor? 130mm naval artillery? We've got it all… Even a catsuit, everything you can imagine (*￣3￣)╭\n\nMachinery Dynamics + Roguelike: Tons of Builds\nRandom item drops, non-random modifications. No gains without hard work and no blind development. Your fate is in your own hands, let science guide your quest for strength! Remember: not all modifications are beneficial! (But at least you might learn something about machinery dynamics)\n\nResist the Overlords! Slay the Inquisitor!\nGorillas, brains, bombers... Challenge \"overseers\" of robot society, drive out the \"wicked hounds,\" breach \"security\" and deliver the killing blow to the Final Inquisitor!",
