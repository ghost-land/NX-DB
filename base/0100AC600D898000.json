The little town he was summoned was silent as if it's the end. He opened the church's rusty old door and four old men wearing red robes greeted him with a grim smile. One of the priests stepped forward and said, \"The Gates are open\".\n\nFeatures:\n- Embark on your journey, travel through 30 different dungeons! Grow powerful as enemies keep getting harder. How far can you go?\n- Unique enemies to fight with and many more to come!\n- 30 handcrafted dungeons!",
