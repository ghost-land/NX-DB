Quick Race is a simple racing game where you can compete with AI or on a split screen with your friend.\nMain features included in the game:\n\n- Tournament mode \n- Topdown camera mode\n- 10 tracks with different shapes and surfaces\n- the ability to change the time of the day\n- the ability to change AI difficulty\n- different types of cars\n- split-screen\n- simple steering\n\n\n\"Quick Race\" is definitely not a simulation game, but the steering is designed to imitate real steering as closely as possible. Remember to be a nice driver to the other cars, otherwise they won't be nice to you and you may end up crashing into a wall or going off the track. So what are you waiting for? Grab the key and put it in your racer's ignition!\n",
