    "description": "Within the perpetually war-torn metropolis of Promethea, you'll control Anu, Octavio, and Fran on the worst day of their lives. Help these three lovable losers as they endeavor to change the world (and maybe even save it)!\n\nIt's time to fight back against exploitation and corporate greed. It's time to make Mayhem your business.\n\nTHREE NOBODIES ON A MISSION\nDecide the fates of altruistic scientist Anu, her ambitious, \"\"streetwise\"\" brother Octavio, and the fierce, frogurt-slinging Fran. With nothing left to lose and everything to gain, you'll claw and con your way through this thrilling five-part story full of gun-toting goons, otherworldly beasts, and delicious tacos.\n\nAN EXPLOSIVE CINEMATIC ADVENTURE\nThe Borderlands aren't just home to Vault Hunters, psychos, and weapons-corp CEOs—they're full of downtrodden, intrepid civilians just trying to get by. With a host of returning and fresh faces, including an assassin bot with comedic aspirations and a less-murderous-than-usual bandit, this unforgettable tale is sure to delight fans new and old.\n\nYOU CONTROL THE FINAL OUTCOME\nThe decisions you make determine how your story ends. Whether it's Anu's vision of a universe that markets more than weapons, Octavio's dreams of fame and fortune, or Fran's frosty plot for revenge—their success or failure depends on you.",
