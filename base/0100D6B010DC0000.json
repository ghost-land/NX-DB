    "description": "Welcome to the Cyber Complex!\n\nIn the year 2041 global corporations replaced countries and the neuro interface implant became a requirement to work - a requirement to survive...\nEverything, and everyone, is connected. Every move is tracked and there is no more space for individuality. We learned to live with it - we had to. The Eurasian V-Eye Corporation, owning 55 percent of the global resources, started to implant a new compulsory brain mod that was meant to improve the population's productivity.\nIt worked - but not the way people expected it to. The new implant robbed us of the last scrap of our free will and people lost their last bit of individuality.\nBut in this environment of total control, slowly, over many years some began to wake up, to regain their humanity. Some of us came together and formed a resistance. Join us today to stop V-Eye's plans to enslave humanity.\n\nAs a resistance recruit you will receive a modified H4C-Kit and access our mod database. You will get access to the Cyber Complex Simulator to create and test new environments.
