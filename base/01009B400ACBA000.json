It is up to you to protect the realm and restore Noobland to glory!\n\n- 1 to 4 players \nInvite all your three friends to play with you! Two? One...? None?! Then revel in our single player mode, if playing solo is your style! If not...\n\n- Local and online multiplayer\nPlay with your friends either locally or online. No friends? No problem! Join an online match with other Non-Heroic figures all over the world!\n\n- 2 Game Modes: Normal and Nightmare\nIs Normal mode not challenging enough? Nightmare mode offers the frighteningly ominous reality of a true horde invasion!",
