    "description": "Mirenia is an 18 year old girl on a quest for redemption. After unleashing an evil power when she was a teenager, she is now on her way to Tirkin Fortress to perform an ancient spell that should help her vanquish the very evil she unleashed three years ago. \nNow, nearing the end of her quest, she arrives in the villages just outside the fortress, where monsters ravage; young women are being taken and men are being slaughtered. Armed with her trusted Shield Blade, Mirenia is so close to undoing the mistakes of her past. Will she succeed or ultimately only make matters worse?\n\nThe Skylia Prophecy is a sidescrolling action RPG set in a medieval fantasy world. As Mirenia, you will journey throughout the lands and towns, explore ancient dungeons and battle hordes of the undead in this hard as hell adventure inspired by the 'kill the player' philosophy of the 'Souls' games. Along your way you will meet the people of these lands, who will ask you to help them, sell you powerful items and reveal secrets to aid you on your journey. By interacting with the townsfolk, you will ultimately receive rewards that make the game easier in the long run - thus, you set the difficulty for the final stretch yourself!\nWill you find redemption or ultimately end up among the dead?\n\nThe Skylia Prophecy will challenge you on every turn with its hard but fair difficulty, powerful bosses and exploration based riddles.\n",
