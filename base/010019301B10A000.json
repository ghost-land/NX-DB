However, she soon discovers that her grandpa is missing and that his farm was recently destroyed.\n\nKey Features:\n\nCLEANING\nClean the world, destroy mountains of trash, vacuum all the rubbish, and recycle resources to build your very own dream farm! Everything you need can be found and recycled from trash, and if you befriend local neighbours, they may prove very helpful during your farming and adventuring endeavours.\n\nFARMING\nFind seeds, become a farmer, and use your produce to cook delicious dishes that can be traded for useful items! There are tons of plants, fruits, vegetables, flowers and trees to find and grow. You can also make honey, jams, mayo, and lots of other preserves to spice up the farming fantasy. \n\nEXPLORATION\nExplore and go on adventures through many diversified zones.
