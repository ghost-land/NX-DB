In Attack of the Toy Tanks, across the game’s 60 levels in the main campaign, players must take control of the provided vehicle of war and battle it out across different arenas and be the last tank standing.\n\nJust in case the AI controlled threat doesn’t offer up enough of a challenge, you can always check out the multiplayer mode and go head to head against a friend.\n\nMust warn you though, it’s not just the heavy artillery you will need to avoid as there is also a range of devastating obstacles that can KO’ you upon impact. \n\nFeatures: \n* 60 levels with increasing difficulty\n* Arena based gameplay\n* 2 Player Battle Mode",
