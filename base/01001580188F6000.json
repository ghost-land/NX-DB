    "description": "In Apré Lapli, Maya and her grandpa share the story of her parents, riding a cart dragged by a giant dragon, on the road in a scarce and dry world. He tells her about how they met, grew together and also why the water is so rare.\n\nIn parallel, Maya dreams about water, and vegetation. She clearly sees scenes where water flows in abundance. Vegetation grows under her feet as she unveils one of the 10 poems of the adventure.\n\nApré Lapli is a short experience. Mostly narrative, the game offers four types of experiences, each intended to be more relaxing than the previous:\n\nSometimes, you control the cart and have to reach a camp. A small indicator will help you find your way but this desert is an open world so nothing stops you from exploring it. At times, Granpa and Maya talk to each other; you just have to ride along with them, listen to their story..\n\nOn occasions, you control Maya and experience one of her dreams with her; As Maya progresses through the short level, you unveil a short poem.\n\nOn other occasions, you control both characters at the same time. Maya, by moving the left stick of the controller; Granpa, by moving the right stick of the controller. You have to solve simple puzzles, find food, or water. Each character has its own specificities; only Granpa has the strength to lift rocks, only Maya has the speed enough to catch beetles ...\n\nOnce the camp objectives are completed, you can sit next to the fire and progress through the story-telling.. But, are you sure you found all the collectibles of that camp? ",
