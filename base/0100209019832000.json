    "description": "A third-person roguelite horror adventure where you play as four characters, experiencing an intergenerational storyline tied to the haunting traditions of an ancient village in Sardinia, Italy, a region rich with unique folklore… The village itself is an elaborate maze with no two iterations being precisely the same—you will have to explore and solve the mysteries of the game largely unguided.\n\nDie, and watch the village reconfigure itself into a new form. Solve puzzles and open shortcuts to new areas with tools and items you find along the way, unlocking every piece of the story with different characters, each with its own power and suited for another aspect of exploration and investigation.\n\nGame Features:\n\n● The village structure changes each time all your characters die\n● Discover characters' special abilities, use tools and consumables to open shortcuts\n● Keep narrative and puzzle progress across game-overs (roguelite)\n● Manage your supply of matches to help your sight and solve puzzles\n● Non-linear progression, dynamic and adaptive narrative\n● Investigate the ritual at the heart of the game and use what you find to stop it\n● Puzzles deeply integrated with the game world and narrative (not abstract)\n● Artwork and animations inspired by stop-motion and rotoscoping film techniques",
