    "description": "Wrap your way to bliss in Zen Bound 2, the unique down-tempo indie game! This is an opportunity to slow down, zone out, and focus on a task that’s challenging but not stressful: a set of gentle spatial puzzles.\n\nThe goal of the game is to paint wooden sculptures by wrapping them with rope. You accomplish this by rotating the Joy-Con™ in your hands like it were the sculpture on the screen - a simple task with surprising complexity.\n\nZen Bound 2 is a calm and meditative gameplay experience, with tactile, dusty visuals and a sublime, enveloping soundtrack by the electronic artist ‘Ghost Monkey’.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Motion controlled gameplay\n- Over 100 levels\n- Achievements\n- Exclusive 5.1 surround soundtrack\n- Beautiful high definition visuals",
