    "description": "Build a huge prison, crafting every building, every room, and every path and furnish them as you like!. Be sure the layout you design makes efficient use of the power grid and water systems. \n\nRehabilitate the prisoners, that's what it's all about! Send them to all sorts of therapies, from the zero gravity room to a hologram room to dance therapy (pole dance anyone?). \n\nHelp inmates address their issues and return to society. Hire expert staff to fill all kinds of roles in your prison. Assign them to work, promote the best and fire the rest. \n\nDesign and maintain the security systems of your prison and be ready for night escapes. Decide on the placement of cameras, watchtowers, and guards to make sure your prison is a safe place.",
