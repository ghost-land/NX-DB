    "description": "In Repressed, the standard physical hero is abandoned, which affects the change in the environment in which he is able to function. As a shadow, the player must make sure to stay in the light and have space to bounce back. It is therefore important to use the right perspective. Changing the angle of the camera can unlock previously unseen paths.\nAs they travel through the world, players collect fragments of their memories, which then have to be reassembled.",
