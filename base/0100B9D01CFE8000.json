    "description": "In Wood Guy, you play as a wooden puppet, exploring a world of handicrafts.\n\nWith only your arms to move, climb (and fly?), you will face many challenges across more than 300 levels and bosses. Make good use of the weapons and shields you find along the way and hit those targets! Remember that gravity and physics are just a barrier that mean almost nothing to a living wooden toy trying to escape!\n\nPlay alone to reach the end or ask a friend to join you and help. Also enjoy the Versus game mode where you can fight against up to 3 friends locally in a small arena to see who's the best puppet.",
