    "description": "Explore a colorful shoot 'em up with varied and diverse gameplay beyond the familiar shooting and dodging. Every situation, every enemy, and every boss offers a different handcrafted experience.\n\nJourney across burning mountains, frozen plains, below the ocean, and outer space, driven towards an unknown goal. Collect ancient fragments of mysterious origin, and try to find yourself, while the world around you falls into darkness.\n\nAre you really doing the right thing?\n\nHave Fun (Gameplay)\n- Experience more than 50 different handcrafted arcade stages and 10 challenging bosses across 8.5 areas.\n- Swing around enemies, hide in the dark, jump through space and time, rotate with the environment, and avoid tricky obstacles.\n- Each stage is carefully introduced, gradually advanced, and twisted into countless exciting variations.\n\nBe in Control (Accessibility)\n- You can change difficulty and game speed, or equip a shield to fit your playing style.\n- Practice individual stages and find the best strategy, or play everything at once in Classic Mode.\n- Disable unwanted effects, adjust the interface, rotate the screen (Tate), and remap controls to your liking.\n\nReach the Top (Scoring)\n- Race against time, keep up your multiplier, and break the highscore.\n- Solve additional tasks to receive bonus points and try to get the highest medal in every stage.\n- Unlock trophies by turning the rules upside down and thinking outside the box.\n\nWork Together (Multiplayer)\n- A completely new experience: Local co-op changes how some of the stages work and feel.\n- Play with a friend and support one another.
