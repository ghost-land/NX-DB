    "description": "Dark Sauce is a cubical platforming game that delivers everything the true gamer needs: colourful 3D graphics with voxels, challenging levels, memorable NPCs, dungeons, dragons and valuable loot!\n\nDelve deep into the dungeon full with villainous monsters and lethal traps. Mountains of gold will be your reward, but beware — ancient and dangerous dragon relentlessly guards them.\n\nTake this challenge if you dare. You'll have to overcome complex levels and take down the powerful dragon, who keeps gold treasures safe. And one more thing — you don't have any super-abilities. You are just a small piggy who ventured deep into the dark and dangerous dungeon. Try to survive it!",
