    "description": "Animal Drifters is a wonderful arcade game where your focus is simple, you need to drive your kart and reach the end of the level before all the others. But there are lots of bonuses along the way and plenty of coins for you to grab. On top of that, you will also encounter a lot of obstacles that you need to avoid. \n\nThat makes Animal Drifters highly engaging, tons of fun, and you always end up with new objectives to pursue. \n\nFeatures:\nChoose from many different drivers\nLots of power-ups spread all over the racing map\nFulfill objectives as you play\nGreat replay value",
