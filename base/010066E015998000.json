    "description": "Math is boring, so they say. Well, no more.\n\nNew in version 4.0: horizontal math operations and Magic Wand. With horizontal math operations you can see your math problems in horizontal format. With the help of a math teacher we have included by default this feature. Vertical is still an option. Also the Magic Wand allows the player yo capture the numbers with the power of the wand. Also you can deactivate it if you want.\n\nMath Classroom Challenge is an educational game in first person view, with the mission of solving the different random mathematical exercises proposed. To do this, you have at your disposal a water hose, with which you must water the numbers and the appropriate solutions. All this in a safe environment to learn mathematics in a fun and enjoyable way. It's also the kids version of Math Combat Challenge.\n\nMath Classroom Challenge is designed for children over the age of four. In the game the player can do several activities: learn the numbers that fly, learn how to throw the water, solve the static panels looking for the corresponding numbers, and solve the dynamic panels that appear suddenly with three solutions. Always throwing the water from the hose to the correct solution.\n\nIn Math Classroom Challenge there are two types of mathematical panels with hundreds of math combinations: static and dynamic.\n\nThe static panels propose random exercises, of configurable difficulty, whose numbers have to be searched through the stage, and bathe them with the water of the hose that we carry.\n\nDynamic panels appear anywhere, but can be repositioned, or even invoked manually, and contain three solutions. Irrigate with water the correct solution. Dragons, on the other hand, allow an error to be subtracted, although sometimes they will cause the opposite: they will add up to an error. So the player must decide whether to use them or not. The rocket, when it takes off, multiplies the points obtained by two during the flight.\n\nThe maximum time, from infinity to two minutes, can be set to resolve static panels. Dynamic panels can be invoked as many times as desired, but always one at a time.\n\nIn the game the player never loses. There is simply a parametrizable timer, and you can choose the type and complexity of mathematical operations, from sums to equations. The errors of the dynamic panels are counted, but they can be reduced if the flying dragons get wet. Although caution, sometimes this can give opposite results if used too much.\n\nMath Classroom Challenge is a game for the whole family, which aims to make young people come into contact with mathematics in a fun and entertaining way.",
