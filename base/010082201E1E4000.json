Use clues found in the book to translate an ancient language, evade the lurking horrors, and solve the mystery of the strange objects around you!\n\nA compact, detailed puzzle thriller ala The Room or Myst that acted as the precursor for mechanics that would make their way into My Friendly Neighborhood. Made by John Szymanski, director of My Friendly Neighborhood.",
