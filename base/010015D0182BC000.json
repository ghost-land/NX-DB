    "description": "Remember that the growth of the city is random, so each game will be unique! \n \nMini Subway: Logic on the Metro Line is a game in which you will design the subway station network of a city. Trace different lines between stations and put all your trains in motion, but be careful! All passengers have to reach their destination. Make your routes efficient and modify them as new stations are opened. Decide how to use your limited resources - how long can you keep the city running at full capacity? \n \nChallenge yourself every day by improving your management skills!",
