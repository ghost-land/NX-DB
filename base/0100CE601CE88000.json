    "description": "Cotton, the legendary witch is back, and this time in 3D! \n\nGet ready for this formerly Japanese exclusive cute ‘em up gem to be “reconjured”. \n\nININ and Success have teamed up once again to bring you a massively improved - and for the first time worldwide - re-release of Rainbow Cotton. \n\nOriginally released in 2000 on Sega's Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton takes you on an arcade-inspired journey through a number of fantastically designed, enchanting stages: from a cozy moonlit town draped in Christmas lights, through a mysterious sunken forest, all the way to a magical castle above the clouds. Clothed in charming 3D graphics these levels include massive bosses as well as alternative routes to explore, guaranteeing high replay value. \n\nSo, collect power-ups to build up your flashy projectiles and hurl them at the colorful enemies. Use powerful magic attacks to clear the screen with fireballs and lighting. Together with some trusty fairies you might stop the evil demon Tweed and help Cotton secure the elusive willow candy for herself. \n\nThis already magical experience is enhanced by fully localized anime cutscenes and a graphical overhaul, as well as numerous quality-of-life improvements. \n\nFeatures:\n\nDedicated Retro Mode: replicating the original experience as closely as possible.\n \nEnhanced controls: Revamped snap-back and lock-on features for a more engaging experience.\n\nFull localization, including the anime cutscenes!\n\nGraphic enhancements: particle effects, ambient occlusion, and more! \n\n",
