Repair and customise your dilapidated (and slightly haunted) mansion.\n\nCrafty Cook!\nA chef is only as good as their tools. Gather resources to craft specialised machinery that can process your ingredients, and even create new recipe components! \n\nExplore Ambrosia!\nYou are free to explore all that the city has to offer. Visit various locations such as the tavern, the spa or try your hand at fishing. Meet the friendly locals and make them hate you less with the power of food.\n\nTale as old as Thyme \nEnjoy a humourous story, with an elaborate cast of characters, all woven into a world inspired by the writing of Sir Terry Pratchett\n\nGrab your spatula and start on a journey to become Epicâ€¦.Chef.",
