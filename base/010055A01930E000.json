    "description": "A collection of 7 different puzzle game modes (each with 50 levels) based on the box-pushing “Sokoban” genre of games.  The game modes are all circuitry/electricity themed, but don't worry: prior knowledge of circuitry is not necessary.\n\n(Note: you will NOT be a certified electrician after completing the game.)\n\nThe modes include:\nLighton - Assemble a circuit and turn on all the lights.  Watch out though, if you make a short circuit it will EXPLODE!\nLighton: Duo - Assemble circuits, but be careful: you can switch between yellow and blue modes and can only move the same colored circuitry!\nPuzzle Light - Complete circuitry by swapping the position of two static tiles.\nPuzzle Light: One Move - A logic puzzle where you must figure out how to complete the target with a single move!\nPuzzle Light: Rotate - Complete circuitry by rotating circuitry tiles in place.\nPuzzle Light: Slide - This time your tiles can only be slid around the game board in a cardinal direction and won't stop until they hit another tile or a wall.\nPuzzle Light: Connect - Move the whole circuit around as you pick up more pieces!\n\nFeatures:\n* 7 different game modes\n* 350 level different puzzle levels (50 per mode)\n* Clean, minimalist graphics",
