    "description": "Tee off simultaneously to a psychedelic 2D world, with satisfyingly simple physics, except it’s a frenetic free-for-all to get in the hole. It’s instant fun with endless variety; there are trillions of gameplay combinations, from giant banana balls to turbo power-ups. This spontaneous couch party may drive a wedge between friends, but have everyone shouting “just one more round!”\n\n- 4-player local-multiplayer and even 8-player matches with wacky shared controller mode\n- over 100 included game modes, and you can make your own with our super powerful gameplay customisation system\n- procedurally generated terrains so you'll never play the same hole twice\n- over 10 different powerups to suit any play style \n\n... and crazy powerups, night golf, checkpoints, elimination modes, rat-king... the number of ways to play is practically endless!",
