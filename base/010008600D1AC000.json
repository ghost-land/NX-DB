    "description": "Love is a universal feeling, but each of us experiences it in a different way. Solo: Islands of the Heart explores the theme of love in an introspective way, allowing players to identify and reflect on their own experiences. \n\nThe world is divided into archipelagos, with each island representing a unique puzzle. Solving puzzles will award the player with a Sleeping Totem, awakening them to answer a question about love and relationships.\n\nAs with love, most puzzles have no unique solution. Using boxes, each with different properties and behaviors, players can build their own paths to the Sleeping Totems on each island. \n\nNature and contemplation are also a huge part of Solo: pull out your camera and capture the moment, play the guitar, feed the animals or just sit on a bench and think.",
