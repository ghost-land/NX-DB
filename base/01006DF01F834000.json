    "description": "The only goal of the game is to push the ball to its destination. Sounds easy, right? Then buckle up, because you’re in for a real challenge.\nChoose between up to five directions to move the ball: up, down, left, right and stop. Arrange your movements in the correct order and see how the ball reacts to your commands in a turn-based environment.\nTo make things more interesting, Game features more than one ball on some levels to add complexity and flexibility to its levels. Keep in mind the movements that will happen when the balls collide and plan your strategy accordingly.\nMaster conveyor belt mechanics that will move your ball in certain directions. These conveyor belt boxes have their own timelines, so you will have to carefully plan how they affect your sequence of actions.\nEnjoy more than 200+ levels where you will be tested. Game doesn’t feature filler levels: once you learn the basic mechanics, you will face real challenges immediately.",
