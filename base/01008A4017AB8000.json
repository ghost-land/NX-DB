Groundskeeper2 throws you in the middle of a war, the war with supernatural robots from outer space.. yeah.. we went there!\n\nEvery time you play this game you will get further and have a better chance at surviving. You’ll unlock new weapons like the machine-gun, laser-gun, rocket-launcher, and tools like all-destroying light-beams, shields, time-slowdowns, and more!\n\nWhat’s more important, you’ll unlock new worlds and hopefully become a true hero for the resistance… or you die a quick death and try again!",
