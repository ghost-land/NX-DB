    "description": "Leap into the fast-paced arcade combat and puzzle-packed platforming of two outstanding adventures for tomb raiders of all abilities; enjoyably easy to pick up, rewardingly difficult to master.\n\nPenetrate dense jungles and navigate elaborate Aztec ruins in Lara Croft & the Guardian of Light, and investigate the cursed tombs of ancient pharaohs in Lara Croft & the Temple of Osiris. Blast through hordes of supernatural foes, overcome intricate Challenge Tombs, beat high scores, and equip yourself with a massive arsenal of unlockable weapons, equipment, and magical artifacts.\n\nTWO ACTION-PACKED ADVENTURES IN ONE\nRace against time in Guardian of Light to unlock the secrets of the Mirror of Smoke and imprison Xolotl, the Aztec god of lightning and death, before he can plunge the world into eternal darkness. \n\nAnd in Temple of Osiris, battle through Ancient Egyptian burial tombs to reunite the Fragments of Osiris and prevent Set, god of evil, from enslaving all of humanity.\n\nFAST-PACED ARCADE COMBAT\nPit yourself against relentless hordes and massive mythical bosses in trap-filled arenas, staying on the move to avoid attacks while putting your selected arsenal to best use.\n\nAN ARSENAL AT YOUR DISPOSAL\nExpand your loadout by unlocking awesome weapons, stat-boosting artifacts and power-enhancing amulets. Experiment with different combinations to suit your playstyle.\n\nREWARDING PUZZLES\nSolve fiendish environmental puzzles, and decode the ingeniously designed Challenge Tombs to unlock bonus rewards.\n\n2-4 PLAYER LOCAL CO-OP\nTeam up with a friend — or two or three — to take down waves of enemies, tackle tombs and compete for treasure, artifacts, and bragging rights.",
