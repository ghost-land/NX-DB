Featuring 50 selectable animatronic characters spanning seven Five Nights at Freddy's games, the options for customization are nearly endless. Mix and match any assortment of characters that you like, set their difficulty from 0-20, then jump right into the action!

As if all of that weren't enough, you'll also need to set up laser traps in the vents, collect Faz-Coins, purchase items from the prize counter, and as always, keep a close eye on not one, but two, Pirate Cove curtains!\n\nOther features include:\n\n- Challenge menu including sixteen themed challenges.\n- Voice acting from returning favorites as well as from new arrivals to the franchise!\n- Unlockable office skins!\n- Unlockable cutscenes!",
