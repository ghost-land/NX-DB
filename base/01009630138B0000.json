    "description": "Today's the grand opening of the Cartown Zoo, and there's still so much to do: zoo chow is running low, and all the baby animals are missing. Putt-Putt® and Pep need your child's help to reunite the little ones with their parents before Outback Al can open the gates. Along the way, they'll swing across alligator-infested rivers, play ice hockey with a polar bear, build a bridge out of icebergs, bop with dancing penguins, and enjoy other adventures. This zoo is full of loyal friends and captivating challenges that are sure to run wild through your child's imagination.\n\n* Take breaks from the action to play games, sing songs, paint Putt-Putt® or learn about the animals you find in the zoo.\n* Click Points reveal hundreds and hundreds of hidden surprises.\n* Out of time? You can save the game and finish it later.\n",
