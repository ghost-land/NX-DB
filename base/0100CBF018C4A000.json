    "description": "Speedgunner Ultra mixes two different genres in a very impressive way — platforming and shoot-em-up. By pressing just one button you can switch between two variations: armed cyborg with ability to fire rockets and reactive jet with ability to dash and accelerate. Use your forms and abilities wisely to overcome the challenges and crush your enemies. When you play Speedgunner Ultra, only you decide on how to surpass in-game records. So, friend, show us what you’ve got!",
