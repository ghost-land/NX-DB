    "description": "A strange knight sat in front of a fire, darkness surrounding him. His sword stuck in the ground, covered in dried blood. He warns you against going any further, but the intrigue of what lies beyond far surpasses the instinct of self-preservation.  \n \nPlay as a young thief and explore the dangerous ruins of a once-prosperous kingdom. Fight against hordes of terrifying monsters, make your way through challenging platforming sections and discover the secret that lies at the very bottom of the ruins in this handcrafted experience. \n\nChrysolite is a narrative driven, pixel-art, 2D platformer with Soulslike inspirations. \n\n● Intriguing narrative \n\nThere is more to these ruins that meets the eye. Find the pieces, connect the dots and discover the dark story of the last days of the kingdom. \n\n● Simple, yet challenging gameplay \n\nJump, attack and use the potions you may find along the way. It may seem simple at first but the ruins will put your skills to the test. \n\n● Fight an army of darkness \n\nAs you make your way through the ruins, you will have to face an increasingly challenging cohort of monsters, including a few tough bosses. Groovy. \n\n● Beautiful hand-drawn illustrations \n\nChrysolite uses hand-drawn illustrations to advance the narrative. You will be able to revisit each piece in the extras menu. ",
