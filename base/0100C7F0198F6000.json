    "description": "Obsessed with occult rituals, you have finally obtained the last thing you need to summon the eldritch horror that has been haunting your dreams; a strange, bright-pink Necronomicon. You perform the only ritual that doesn’t appear to be insane ramblings, and inadvertently summon Ln’eta, a cute cthulhu-like girl. She agrees to a kiss, on the condition that you perform a few rituals from the book for her first. Looking back at the Necronomicon… all of the other pages suddenly make sense?\n\n● Three chapters of laughs, screams, and tears, all in one thick package!\n● Every decision you make will significantly affect gameplay and determine which ending you arrive at!\n● Immersive re-imagining of the visual novel genre loaded with gameplay!\n● \"Three\" \"fully-voiced\" \"dateable\" \"girls\"\n● A stylish artistic/musical direction reminiscent of old-school anime and dating sims!\n● No horror elements or danger whatsoever",
