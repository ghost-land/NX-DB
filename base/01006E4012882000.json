The world’s superpowers realize they could have the power to destroy the global financial system, wipe out entire countries or even gain access to immortality.\nHowever, this discovery — called “The Sigma Theory” — can only be harnessed by a handful of scientists. You are placed at the head of your country’s Sigma division. Your objective is to ensure that it is your nation that reaps the benefits of Sigma Theory before anyone else.\nTo achieve this, you will have powerful resources at your disposal: a cadre of the world’s most elite covert agents, advanced tactical drones and, of course, your own skills in diplomacy and subterfuge.\nIt’s a cold war out there, one in which mankind must face up to its future.\n\nTHE ULTIMATE ESPIONAGE SIMULATION\nTurn-based espionage: Use your special agents to dominate the world. Seduction, blackmail, manipulation, industrial espionage… Every low blow is both permitted and encouraged.\nDynamic narrative: Develop and manage your relations with over 100 NPCs: lobbies, armed groups, politicians… Alliance, deception, or assassination, you choose.\nField operations: Direct the kidnapping of your targets during gripping pursuits through the world’s greatest cities. Discretion or direct confrontation, your agent’s life is in your hands.\n\nRECRUITMENT\nFirst, recruit a team of four special agents from 50 unique unlockable characters to support your missions. Each comes with their own story, motivations and traits that define their behavior during missions.\nAccess the investigator, soldier, hacker, seducer and other archetypes to complete your Sigma division and execute your strategy.\n\nESPIONAGE\nWhen your team is ready, assign them missions around the world to gather scientists, discover compromising documents on local politicians, and more.\nExploit your agents’ abilities to seduce, manipulate and bribe your targets over to your side or have them neutralized.\n\nCOUNTER-ESPIONAGE\nOther nations will also use their agents to infiltrate your country and seize your scientists. Track, capture and interrogate them to gain information on your enemies, then exchange them for ransom when they are no longer useful.\n\nEXFILTRATION\nOrder your agents to exfiltrate scientists recruited to your cause during gripping turn-based exfiltration phases through the world’s greatest capitals. Choose the position your drones wisely to support these delicate missions.\n\nDIPLOMACY\nIn Sigma Theory, diplomacy is the key to achieving your goals.
