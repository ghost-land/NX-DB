    "description": "In Guns N’ Runs, you take control of 8 skillful members of the Conspiracy Squad, in a stylish platform game, action and shooter, totally drawn by hand in pixel art, where time is the primordial factor at the battle against a prodigy technopath and his army of robots.\n\nHelp our protagonists in the invasion of a bunker in the middle of the Atacama desert, in a capture and rescue mission full of challenges and dangers. Made for one player, with over 200 challenges, 23 bosses and focused on the individual narrative of each of the squad members.\n\nThe controls are simple and accessible - you can jump, shoot, dash and use the special - but make no mistake! The game possesses layers of difficulty that require a greater depth of skills to advance to the next levels. In this game, you will learn a new lesson with each death.\n\nUse a variety of weapons, protect yourself with a shield, recover your dash to utilize it in sequence, destroy some enemies with a strengthened dash (if you found) and enjoy every second of the game with an original soundtrack that will leave you excited with each new stage.\n\n\nSo, prepare yourself to die several times and overcome your limits.",
