Engage in epic, energetic boss battles as you defend your hometown.\n\nSmall-town dungeon crawl\nHunt the forces of evil in high school halls, convenience store aisles, and shopping malls. Discover and accept missions from the town’s social media, and track down evil (and other after-school plans) with modern tech.\n\nIn a class of your own\nFreshman life is ultrafast-paced—even more so when you’re the vampire-hunting new kid. Assist and befriend and assist a comic cast of quirky and memorable classmates as you find your place as a teenager in the world of #BLUD.\n\nUpgrade your field arsenal\nDiscover and earn upgrades for Becky’s trusty vampire-slaying field hockey stick to face the mounting challenges, including handy attachments like a grappling hook, shovel, and umbrella shield.\n\nUncover fiendish mysteries\nResearch the demonic legions through means archaic and new.
