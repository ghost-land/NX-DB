    "description": "Take on a real tactical jumping adventure with Egg Over It: Fall Flat from the Top!!! A challenge where you'll have to lift the egg to the top in search of its source, but explore carefully; a single failed jump could lead to a long fall.\n\nGuide it through sewers, buildings, aerial vehicles and skyscrapers.\n\nClimb the egg to the top. Perform aerial moves, walk to be more precise or play using only the boosts.\nAvoid making a wrong move or you will fall into the sewers starting from the beginning.\nRemember that the egg is not circular, so it may play a trick or two on you.\nSee the scenery with a day and night cycle.\nEnjoy the Andalusian music composed with Spanish guitar.\nLet the game's narration envelop you during the game.\nIllo, will you have “huevos” to beat this game?\n\nEgg Over It: Fall Flat from the Top is a game where the only way to advance is “p'arriba”",
