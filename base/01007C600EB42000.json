    "description": "The legendary assassin Travis Touchdown makes his glorious return to the Madness! \n\nOur hero, Travis Touchdown, must make it to the top of the Galactic Superhero Rankings in order to stop the evil Prince FU and his ten alien assassins from taking over the Earth.\n\nEarn money to enter ranked battles! \n\nTo enter into each subsequent ranked battle, you’ll need to pay a pretty steep fee. Travis must take on various missions around town to make the money he needs to fight. An invitation to the next fight will be sent once the required fees have been transferred via ATM.\n\nUse your skills to dominate opponents!\n\nEnjoy even more hardcore slash-‘em-up action than ever before as you use the Joy-Con’s intuitive controls to wield Travis Touchdown’s trusty Beam Katana along with a slew of pro wrestling techniques!\n\nAlso, featured for the first time in the series, Travis can now use his Death Glove to activate a variety of skills, allowing for more strategic battles. Furthermore, you can now customize the new Skill Tree and try out different Death Glove Chip combinations to find the play style that works best for you.\n\nIt’s the Galaxy vs. the Hood in a full-on war by proxy.\n\nBonus in-game T-shirt included!",
