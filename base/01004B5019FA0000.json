    "description": "Dungeons of Aether is a turn-based dungeon crawler designed by Nick ‘ampersandbear’ Blackwood from the Aether Studios team. While Rivals of Aether is known for its real-time combat, Dungeons of Aether allows you to take things at your own pace - but it’s just as challenging!  Every choice you make can lead you deeper into the dungeons or to an early demise. Will you carry out a treasure chest, or be carried out in a pine box?\n\nGame Features:\n- Meet four NEW HEROES from the world of Aether, each with their own unique skills and memorable personalities.\n- Play STORY MODE and travel to the steam-punk town of Julesvale and brave the sprawling caverns underneath it.\n- Explore each DUNGEON BIOME as you dive into Julesvale Mines, the Lava Caves, the Underground Oasis and the Mineral Deposits, collecting revealing Journal Entries along the way.\n- Brave the CHALLENGE DUNGEONS if you are looking for true roguelike difficulty to test your skills in the randomly generated dungeons.",
