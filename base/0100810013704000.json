    "description": "Maya and Devin are separated in a city on fire. In the year 1990, before cell phones or Internet. Theyâ€™re on their own, wondering about the choices that brought them here, how they met, and what the future might hold.\n\nInspired by Information Society's song of the same name, Fire Tonight is a lighthearted but thoughtful walk through the story of a relationship. A story about believing in each other when the whole world tries to keep them apart.",
