My new video game, Membal, is a serene game filled with adorable animals, aiming to train memory while enjoying the construction of a small village.\nThis game is truly important to me because the idea of a memory training game came to me when I was about 16, and my aunt was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. I wanted to create a game to help her and others with memory issues. Perhaps it was naive and innocent, but I was genuinely focused on making it happen. Back then, I did almost all the art, but lacked the coding skills. After 5 years of developing my own games, I finally decided to finish it. I had to redo all the art, and now, I've finally brought it to life.\nUnfortunately, my aunt passed away two years ago. Therefore, I decided this game would be a tribute to her, making her one of the main characters assisting the player. I hope this game can help those in need and those seeking to enhance their memory and keep their minds active!",
