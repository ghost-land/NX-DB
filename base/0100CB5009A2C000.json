    "description": "RAZED is a lightning-fast, single-player platform racing game that's all about speedrunning. \nSprint through dynamic neon levels in the quickest time possible, employing skills such as super-speed boosts, mega-jumps, drifts, stomps and strafes to bypass obstacles and uncover shortcuts to propel yourself up the online leaderboards. But there's a catch: powers cost momentum, and if your energy falls too low your shoes (and you) could very well explode...\n  \nNON-STOP ESCALATION\nSprint through 60 dynamic levels spread across six unique worlds, each with a distinct visual style, unlockable ability and pulse-pounding boss battle.\n  \nCHART YOUR OWN COURSE\nVeer off the beaten path and carve your own way through levels to achieve seemingly impossible times and unlock the S ranks.\n  \nONLINE LEADERBOARDS AND GHOST DATA \nChallenge the world via online leaderboards, and race against friends' ghosts in a game of asynchronous one-upmanship.\n  \nFUSS-FREE SPEEDRUNNING\nNobody wants to wait around while striving for perfection. Falling short of your target time? Simply jab the restart button to return to the start of the level without any loading times.\n  \nSECRET CHALLENGE LEVELS\nEmploy all your different abilities to find RAZED's toughest maps and tackle them head-on.",
