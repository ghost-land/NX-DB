    "description": "Puzzle Pedestrians is not your ordinary puzzle game!\nObserve and guide pedestrians to help them have a safe time on their way to work, school, or otherwise fulfilling your mission objectives. With your toolkit of items such as bees and bananas, you’ll help moms deliver lunches to forgetful children, deliver more foot traffic to struggling shops, and so much more!\n\nPlanned and produced by Kenichi Nishi of Route 24, famous for his work on games such as “Moon: Remix RPG Adventure”, “L.O.L.: Lack of Love”, and “Chibi-Robo!”.",
