    "description": "Difficult challenges - a big reward:\nRunning an aquarium shop is a real challenge! Clients will entrust you with difficult tasks that you have to cope with. In return, a reward awaits you. Spend it on developing your business - buying new species of fish, exotic plants, equipping your store or developing your skills.\n\nLet your imagination run wild:\nCreate an aquarium in which each fish will want to live. Thanks to the variety of objects in the game, you can implement even the craziest ideas! A green, blooming oasis or raw, antique busts? The choice is yours.\n\nRecycling and ecology:\nEvery self-respecting entrepreneur cares about his business. Refurbishing and processing aquarium components will save you a lot and take care of the environment.\n\nUnderwater dance:\nWe offer you many species of fish and freshwater plants. Your task is to create an ecosystem that is balanced and safe for the inhabitants of your aquariums. Remember that a slight deviation from the parameters necessary for the survival of one species can be crucial for the survival of another.\n\nA broad perspective:\nRun your store the best you can! Take care of the exhibition, sell ready-made projects and carry out individual orders. In the heat of duties, do not forget about your pupils - you are responsible for ensuring their safety, peace and food.",
