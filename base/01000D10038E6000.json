    "description": "\"LAST RESORT\" is a shoot 'em up game released by SNK in 1992.\n\nPlayers can use weapons such as laser, homing, or grenades, which can be powered up as many as three times, along with a \"unit\" that can nullify enemy bullets and attack foes. Using these abilities and many other attacks players will fight in order to win the war between robots and humanity.\n\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\n\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\n\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
