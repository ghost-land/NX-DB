    "description": "\"Monster Prom 3: Monster Roadtrip\" finally answers the age-old question: \"What if we added survival mechanics to a beloved dating sim franchise?\"\n\nMonster Roadtrip adds a twist to its predecessors Monster Prom and Monster Camp, multiplayer dating sims brimming with beautiful art and unapologetic humor.\n\nThis sequel takes you on an unforgettable road trip along with fan-favorites Scott and Polly. On the way, you will stay at crummy motels, engage in dark cult rituals, help out strangers on the road and pick up more hitchhikers than Scott can count. Bump into old friends and meet plenty of new faces on your way to one of six destinations!\n\nMonster Roadtrip adds three difficulty levels to customize your road trip, and two different multiplayer modes: cooperate with other players or compete to see who the Ultimate Prank Master is! And if it's romance you're looking for, don't fret: we've got you covered! More than 15 characters are waiting for you on the road. Meet them, sit together by the benches at the rest stop, and hold intimate conversarions that may lead to love. \n\nBut that’s not all! The XXL version includes ALL of the DLC playable characters: Zoe, Juan, Hazel and Glitch!\n\nMonster Roadtrip has everything you love about the \"Monster Prom\" formula, and adds new mechanics for a road trip you will remember forever! ;)",
