Explore the biggest prisons yet, with multiple floors, roofs, vents and underground tunnels. You’ll have to live by the prison rules, attending roll call, doing prison jobs and following strict routines; all the while secretly engineering your bid for freedom! Your prison escape antics will take you from the frosty Fort Tundra, to a train hurtling through the desert, and even to the final frontier!\n\nEscape Team Assemble!\n\nUnite with up to 3 friends to create the ultimate online escape crew and engineer the wildest escapes yet!

You’ll soon learn that duct tape solves (almost) everything!\n\nPrepare for a fight!\n\nThe Escapists 2 introduces a brand new combat system to make every prison brawl more exciting and interactive. You’ll have to block and tie together chains of attacks whilst strafing around your locked on targets to gain the upper hand in combat.
