The princesses will have to 'put themselves out there' if they want to solve the puzzles!＞\nThere are many traps which will require the princesses to get their hands, feet, just about every other part of them dirty! \nThere's a time limit for the puzzles, so you have to concentrate on the traps without getting distracted by the women in compromising positions before you!\nAnd forget about clicking on them! You all might enjoy it, but focus or they'll scold you! So keep your eye on the prize, suppress the desire to interact with the princesses, and disarm those traps, just like a real savior of the world should!\nBut the hero's actions in this regard just might affect the fates of all three of you...\n\n<STAFF>\nCharacter Design：AkasaAi／InuiWaon\nScenario production：C-Garden,Inc.\nProducer：Yujiro Usuda",
