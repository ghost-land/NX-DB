    "description": "The Light\nCenturies passed since the High Wizard Zale sacrificed himself to save Celenheim from the hands of Vatar and his legions of Dreg’Atar. The Enclave, the last bastion of the side of light, remained safe enclosed by fortress walls and bottomless chasms. However, the land is beginning to heal and the cliff sides are knitting together. The Shadow forces seek to reignite the war that almost destroyed Celenheim and steal the sacred magic held within the walls of the Enclave. It is up to you to keep the light from being extinguished. \n\nThe Dark\nThe control of Celenheim was ripped from the hands of Vatar and his legions of Dreg’Atar. For years the prosperous magic sought by the darkness was hoarded in the Enclave by the soldiers of light. The great rifts surrounding the city kept Vatar and his Outlanders from breaching its walls, but their luck is beginning to change. The land is seaming itself together and the time to invade is near. The legion of Darkness is ready and it is up to you to gain back what is rightfully yours. \n\nBegin your campaign as a soldier of the Light, defending Celenheim from forces of darkness and the horrid demon king Vatar. Change sides and complete an alternative campaign as a minion of the dark tasked with infiltrating and destroying the Enclave you just sought to protect. Twelve different classes and multiple weapon options create great replayability as you descend dungeons, complete missions, and vanquish your enemies.\n\n• Experience breathtaking combat action as a soldier of light or minion of darkness across two separate story-driven campaigns.\n\n• Enhanced graphics and upgrades for modern consoles.\n\n• Updated and expanded soundtrack.\n",
