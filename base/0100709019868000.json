    "description": "When Furball accidentally drinks a sleeping potion, his owner, the warlock Lux, needs to extract human fear to create an awakening potion. After the evil wizard crashes at the Golden Sands resort and kidnaps all humans, it’s up to the loyal dogs Kenny, Lenny, and Max to rescue their human friends and show Lux that some love and care always beats fear. Superfidos is a platforming game where you explore the vast world of Fluffington. You play as a magical dog hero, traversing different levels in multiple interconnected areas, gathering power-ups, magic, and more to help you in your journey. Unlike a straightforward platformer where you go from one level to the next, Superfidos promotes free exploration, is full of secrets, and provides different ways of approaching and solving the game’s multiple puzzles and challenges. Put your best cape on and help these heroes show Lux they are not called Superfidos for nothing.",
