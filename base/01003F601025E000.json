    "description": "You play as the mysterious blue-haired girl named Dex who is being hunted by a powerful and enigmatic organization for her unique abilities. Explore the misty, futuristic streets of Harbor Prime in this open-world dystopia. Unearth plots and intrigues, forge alliances and take the fight to your enemies on your quest to take down the system!\n\nThe world of Dex is designed as a tribute to some of the greatest neo-noir and cyberpunk worlds with a mature storyline, murky atmosphere and distinct characters. Gameplay is a throwback to classic 2D platforming and action games but mixed with deep RPG elements, interactive dialogues and real-time combat.\n\nCustomize your character’s skills and equipment to match your desired playstyle - kill from shadows as a silent assassin, fight the power head on as a gunfighter, use persuasion like a sly diplomat or fight from a distance in cyberspace as a hacker. Blur the line between being human and \"cyborg\" by installing augmentations that grant you superhuman abilities and open up new paths in Harbour Prime like classic Metroidvania titles.\n\n- Deep RPG mechanics mixed with side-scrolling 2D action\n- Non-linear gameplay set in a cyberpunk open-world \n- Intriguing and mature plot in a neo-noir atmosphere\n- Multiple dialogue choices with branching outcomes\n- Full English voice over\n- Multiple playstyles - stealth, open combat, diplomat, hacker or a mix of the above\n- Various customization options - choose your equipment, skills and even cybernetic implant skills to open up new paths in the city\n- Unique hacking mechanic that lets you dive into Cyberspace\n",
