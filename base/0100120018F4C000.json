    "description": "“Work from Home” is a co-op party game for 1 to 4 players. \nPlayers act as workers who slack off behind their boss and pretend to work when their boss is around. \nAppropriate allocation of \"slacking\" and \"pretending to work\" is the workplace survival rule in \"Work from Home\".\nUse all the things you can reach in the workplace to slack off and have fun with colleagues.\nEnjoy your time, with pay!",
