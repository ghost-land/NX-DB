    "description": "STRATEGY MEETS ACTION: a fresh take on a classic genre. Dynamic track-based battlefield where tactile mechanics meet turn-based card battling.\n\nFROM BEGINNER TO WINNER: rules can be learned in minutes, opening the doors for players of all ages and skill levels. Strong customisation and a complex meta provide long-term depth, making it much harder to master.\n\nENDLESS CHOICE: design your own COMBAT CASE from over 140 CARDS (across 5 categories), 20 GUNS (with stat modifiers) and over 25 CHARMS (each with battle-altering perks).\n\nDISTRICT RUN: a deep Roguelike single-player mode where youâ€™ll build a collection, make key decisions and battle across 5 procedurally generated Districts. Will you survive the elusive SHADOW DISTRICT and conquer the city?",
