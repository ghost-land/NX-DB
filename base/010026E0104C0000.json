    "description": "You have arrived just in time for the yearly Tilt Tournament! That means it is time to pick your fighter and dive head-first into action-packed battles on a quest to become the Ultimate Champion.\nBeing a box has never been that much fun before! Prove your worth by being the last Tilt standing on the interactive arena that is constantly on the move. Push your opponents to their inevitable defeat using a combination of skill, precise movement, and various power-ups, and secure that sweet victory royale!\nLife of a tilt is not an easy one, but it sure is fun. With rotation as your only ability that you can use to navigate the arena, you will always have to take into account the shapes and sizes of your opponents. Itâ€™s easy to grasp how it works, but it takes practice to actually be a good and efficient fighter. Always aim to get rid of your opponents in the quickest way possible as with time, the arenas become more unpredictable and dangerous, leaving no room for mistakes to those who are being too careful. \nKey Features:\n- Physics-based competitive game for friends and family\n- Colorful and hilarious characters\n- Couch-brawler for up to 4 players\n- FUNtastic interactive arenas\n- The easiest controls you could possibly imagine\n",
