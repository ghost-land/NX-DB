    "description": "You play as a Hero accompanied by a Witch and you are seeking revenge, and justice, over the evil Medusa. Medusa turned the Witch into stone, so she is no longer able to move; it’s up to the Hero to defeat the monsters and collect their blood in order to recover the Witch for a limited period of time.\n\nThe Hero leads the fight but can revive the Witch to unleash her destructive powers; as the waves of enemies become stronger they will need to work together! In this Nintendo Switch version you also have the option of co-operative play to take on the challenge with a friend.\n\nWitch & Hero has also been enhanced for the Nintendo Switch™, while retaining its original 8-bit pixel graphics and sound.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy the challenge!
