    "description": "Run, jump, and backflip your way to rescuing the stolen Mini-Mario toys in this puzzling twist on Mario action. Obstacles like spikes, moving platforms, and falling bricks stand in your way—put your brain to work and figure out the best way to reach the Mini-Marios! You’ll have to master Color Switches, Warp Boxes, and more as the difficulty ramps up across more than 130 levels, including challenging Plus and Expert levels. \n\nTailor the challenge to your playstyle or bring a friend along in local multiplayer!\n\nSeeking a laid-back experience? The newly-added Casual Style removes time limits and adds checkpoints so you can relax and think. Looking for a tough puzzle-platforming challenge? Classic Style has got you covered with the timed levels and one-hit defeats of the original Game Boy™ Advance game. But that’s not all—you can bring a friend along in the newly-added Two-Player Mode, which adds an extra objective for Mario and Toad to take on together!\n\nA classic rivalry reignites with updated visuals, new levels, and more ways to play!\n\nWith overhauled graphics, music, and cutscenes, this revitalized classic is looking better than ever. But wait—there’s more! Not only do you get new ways to play with Casual Style and Two-Player Mode, you also get two brand new worlds: Merry Mini-Land and Slippery Summit! That’s two new worlds, each with eight levels (and even more Plus levels), featuring new environments, enemies, and mechanics. And that’s not all! When you finish with those, you can test your skills in a newly-added Time Attack mode that will push your puzzle-platforming speed to the limit!",
