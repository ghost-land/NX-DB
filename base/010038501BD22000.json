But be warned - enemy ships are out to get you! Engage in intense battles as you shoot and destroy these despicable foes, testing your reflexes and aiming skills. Immerse yourself in the thrilling world of boat combat. Survive challenging fights and show off your boat-shooting skills today!\n\nIn this game, you play as a boat that is trying to defend itself from an invasion of opposing ships.\nEach level begins in a different biome with different obstacles, styles, and decorations, teeming with enemies.\nOnce the enemies have spotted you they start moving towards you and start shooting at you with relatively slow flying bullets. You are able to outmaneuver your enemies by simply dodging their bullets or diving beneath them. Then you can use your front or side cannons to fight back against them by shooting at them. At the end of each level waits a big opponent with more energy and bigger bullets. You have 3 lives before the game ends, so be careful not to get hit by a bullet.",
