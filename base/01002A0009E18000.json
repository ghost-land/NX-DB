The players compete to be the last robot standing. Using a charged burst of speed called the JOLT, and an array of different objects in the environment; your goal is to outperform or outright sabotage the other racers. Eliminated players are down but not out through the use of the VOID, a random Sabotage Power-Up that allows players to initiate revenge and change the outcome of the race!\n\nKey Features:\n- JOLT – A charged burst of speed that can effect certain objects\n- VOID – Sabotage Power-Ups from post-elimination\n- Local Multiplayer racing, up to FOUR players\n- Chaotic, fast paced rounds\n- Skill and Timing based gameplay\n- Multiple Tracks\n- Multiple Game Modes\n- Create your own Robot\n\nThe JOLT is a player's primary utility to winning the race. It has 3 stages of charge, each one taking longer to store but each allowing you to shoot considerably further. If the player can time its use correctly; they can use it just before a curve to shoot up a wall or JOLT through an obstacle. Many short cuts in the levels are JOLT dependent.\n\nOnce eliminated, a player has the opportunity to execute the VOID. After punching in the correct sequence, the VOID player is gifted a random Power-Up to inflict mass-disruption to the existing racers.\n\nThe game features multiple Game Modes; Racer is the standard and most game modes are based off this, such as Light Mode (where the level is dark and the leading player has a light attached to them).",
