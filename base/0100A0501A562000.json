    "description": "Search Of Light is a steampunk / dark fantasy setting adventure and the combination of resource management and narrative mechanics that we define as adventure management.\n\nThe player will get into the story from the perspective of The Foreigner, the enigmatic character who must ascend through the levels of the underground to reveal the mystery hidden on the surface. And must do it relying solely on his ingenuity and the help of domestic robots, that still work as assistants for the remaining inhabitants of the underground.\n\nThanks to the combination of mechanics and setting, SOL aspires to position itself as one of the titles that will undoubtedly stand on the wishlist of narrative-loving players, always caring about the challenging aspects of the video game progression. Creating an immersive experience that takes the player further than just fun.\n\nThe adventure begins in an abandoned village in an underground environment, where The Foreigner discovers his ability to reactivate the mechanical elements to protect the village from the enemies.\n\nTo progress in the adventure, the player will have to explore the dark environment outside the village to get new items that will allow him to empower the features of the village, improving weapons and defenses against the enemies that attack every \"night\". In this way he will be discovering the story until reaching the surface.",
