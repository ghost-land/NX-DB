    "description": "Journey as a green LED mysteriously trapped inside a dying boombox and play the ultimate musical experience: bring electro, dub and disco music back to life! \n\nFEATURES\n\nRhythmic awareness is vital when you jump, dash or slam. You have to hit that beat! Never under any circumstances should you play on mute! \n\nFeel creative, play with the music and unleash your inner musician! Inside My Radio lets you compose the track: YOU are in control, either with your actions, movements or jam zone, where you can freely choose and mix the tracks the way you want. \n\nThe game is a mix-tape where every level is a different track: every level brings different variations to electro, disco or dub! \n\nEnjoyed the experience but want more? \nTry to finish the levels before the clock expires, in Time Attack mode. It’s rhythm or die time: the more you hit the beat, the higher your score multiplier goes, the better your score. Don’t miss a beat or you will lose your multiplier AND get a time penalty!",
