    "description": "Apparently there was nothing special at the Whiskey last night this time. This time it is for real. Welcome to the Wild West where the rules have changed.\n\nGunslingers & Zombies is an action-packed and adventurous strategy game that comically combines two themes beloved by pop culture: the Wild West and the Undead. Become one of the gunslingers fighting zombies. Plan your combat tactics and put them into practice in turn-based battles. Explore the crazy world of the Wild West, shown with a pinch of salt, where nothing is normal. Take on the weirdest types of zombies you've seen so far, such as the mighty Buffalo Zombie! Give zombies a taste of your pistols, shotguns, rifles or knives. Let them regret the day they… yyy… the day they became undead!",
