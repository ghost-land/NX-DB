    "description": "PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK\nAt the end of the 1800s the government declared a global ban on this legendary card game due to an increase in bar fights, divorces, and family feuds. It was political correctness gone mad.\n\nAwkward is the ultimate test on finding out how well friends, couples, and family know each other. Players are asked to answer increasingly uncomfortable questions in secret, while their companions try to guess the outcome. \n\nHEATED CLASSICS! Pineapple on pizza, yay or nay?\nRELATIONSHIP CHOICES! What part of your partner do you prefer, body or face?\nHORRIBLE DILEMMAS! If you could only save the life of one, would you choose a 1-year-old or an 18-year-old?\n\nWhether you deduce correctly or incorrectly, games of Awkward help players see each other in a brand new light. And your opinion counts: each Awkward question will let you compare your vote to the rest of the world. Banned for over 120-years, Awkward is back, and you can now enjoy this controversial adult card game as a videogame.\n\nQUALITY GAMEPLAY\nFeaturing the original banned questions, as well as all new content written by Danny Gallagher (Quiplash, Fibbage 2) and Joanna Haslam (Buzz! Quiz World, It's Quiz Time). One to six players can join in, with a huge selection of game modes on offer. Play cooperatively, as teams, competitively, or solo players can play alone to guess how the rest of the world fared with Awkward's controversial questions.\n\nAwkward is the ultimate party game featuring over 5,000 fiendish questions. Do you dare to find out how well you really know each other?",
