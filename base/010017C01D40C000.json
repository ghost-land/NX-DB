    "description": "One day the artist saved a cat that was in trouble, and they began to live together. There were no signs of trouble until one day an evil spirit attacked the artist. After this, the artist became seriously ill and now the wise white cat must help his friend and save him from death.\n\nTo do this, you have to go on a dangerous journey into the world of ghosts and demons. Not all things here are what they seem: to see their true form, you need to have a special cat's vision.\n\nIt will be a difficult path, but not a single demon can stop you!",
