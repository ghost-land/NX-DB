    "description": "In Football Drama, you are Rocco Galliano, the Marseillaise new manager of Calchester Assembled Football Club.\nAfter the abrupt ending of your coaching career seven years ago, the hysterical attention of the press quickly faded. But struggling results by Calchester FC convinced Boris Aluminovitch, its billionaire president, to axe the previous beleaguered manager and give you a new chance.\nWill your raucous shouts from the bench change the fate of the team? Will you find wiseness and karma leadership with the help of the Book of Changes? Will your shady past reach back to you and make you crumble?\n\nChances that you can make it through a full season are slim.
