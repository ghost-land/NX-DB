    "description": "Grab Your Longboard and Race to the Top!\n\nMeet Tanuki, a rad longboarding raccoon from Sunset Island. They may just be a raccoon, but they’re a raccoon with a dream — to land on the cover of FISH, the #1 longboarding magazine in the world!\n\nMaster the longboard as you drift through stunning mountain ranges, swerve through bustling city streets, and board along the sandy beaches of Sunset Island. Train Tanuki to perform epic tricks, from jumping off ramps to longboarding backwards.\n\nSounds easy, right?\nWell, it is… if you can do it all while avoiding cars, trucks, and unexpectedly sharp corners.\nAnd don’t forget to feed him! Raccoons are hungry trash pandas after all. Collect Tanuki Bits along the way to keep Tanuki fed and to upgrade your gear at Bob's Skate Shop. If Tanuki’s going to be on the cover of FISH, they need some cool threads for the occasion. Ready to longboard to the top of the charts?\n\nWhat to Expect:\n- A Clever Raccoon (you)\n- A Colorful and Retro Art Style\n- Chill Beats to Match the Vibe\n- Simple-to-use Controls (mostly)\n- And an Arcade Experience (with a modern twist)\n\nWhat our player's say:\n“that raccoon is my husband now”\n“v aesthetic and v chill n the music is a vibe thank you”\n“Skate fast, eat trash”",
