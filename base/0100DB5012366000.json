Let the electric motors roar and hit the forks!\n\nThis game is stacked up ...\n\nYou thought today was a quiet evening when nothing happened? Wrong, because now the dark drones pose a new threat. Visit the different warehouses and show these windy drones how to stack properly.\n\nLOCAL MULTIPLAYER MADNESS\nYou can choose, work together and reach the high score, battle it out in vs-mode, or just collect boxes in freeplay-mode.\nIts the main objective in story mode to collect as many boxes as you can within a three-minute limit in order to reach three golden boxes to unlock further levels. You have to work cooperatively with up to four players to get each box to its designated delivery station efficiently.\n\nDELIVERY TO ALL COUNTRIES\nIn the warehouse, on the prairie, in old medieval castles and even on dizzyingly high skyscrapers. You stack your load no matter where!\nWork your way through 30 colorful stages with increasing levels of difficulty! These stages are grouped into five worlds, Urban, Asia, Scifi, Western, Medieval.\n\nWORKING WITH PROFFESIONALS\nNo access? No problem! Uses the latest technologies and trends in crate transport. Of course, this also includes springs, assembly lines, and, of course, cannons.\nUse these different gameplay elements to navigate your boxes in creative and efficient ways through the different stages in order to beat the clock!",
