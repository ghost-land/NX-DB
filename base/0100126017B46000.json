    "description": "In an era where espionage is handled largely by data-packets being pored over by teams of analysts, Section Eleven’s approach is more hands-on, dealing with the sorts of criminal organisations who live and operate outside the realms of electronic communication. When the rest of the intelligence services have failed, they call Section Eleven.\n\nAs a Section Eleven agent it is your job to find direct solutions to emerging threats… largely by smashing people’s faces into things.\n\nThe game blends deck-building, turn-based tactics, and thrilling animated fight sequences in classic action-movie settings. Learn to balance your hand, momentum, and positioning to overcome the odds to defeat your adversaries.\n\nPick from over 200 cards as you build a deck to suit your play style and your opponents’. Encounter random events, acquire enhancements (or injuries), and make critical choices about how best to upgrade your agent for the fights ahead.",
