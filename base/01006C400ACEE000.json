Will you keep a cool head and defuse the bomb?\n\nFEATURES\n• Describe what you see to other players\n• Let your Expert Team talk you through the bomb defusal\n• Put your communication skills to the test\n\nWARNING: Time pressure and adrenaline may lead to shouting, swearing, and misunderstandings, which can cause temporary resentment between friends or silent treatment from loved ones!\n\nGAME RULES\nOne of the players takes on the role of the Unlikely Hero, who finds a bomb and tries to defuse it.
