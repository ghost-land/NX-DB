If you want some great brain training, look no further!\n\n•Co-op play is available, so go ahead and enjoy these puzzles with friends, family and more!\n\n•An updated design adds a new layer of polish to the classic gameplay that never gets old even after 30+ years!\n\nTwo Popular Game Modes From Previous Titles Make a Comeback!\n\n•Legend Mode: Beijing\nThis is not your ordinary Shanghai!
