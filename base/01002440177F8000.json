    "description": "Death is not the end\n\nHold on to your soul. Fight death by mashing the corresponding button, and buy yourselves a few extra moments. Every time you die, coming back is going to be much harder.\n\nExpect the unexpected\n\nDont forget, the environment is not your friend. All of the levels are designed to make your life more...interesting. Depending on the map, you'll be dealing with new rules, traps and game altering Lava Tridents, Spears or Swords. If you run out of ammo, headbang to get more. Enjoy the cartoon bloodshed! \n\nFlawless soundtrack\n\nYour glorious journey, wouldn't be complete without an incredible soundtrack. Music is the cherry on top of this game. It's a real treat for all metal fans. Soundtracks and sound effects were made by the veteran duo Fat Bard.\n\nKey features\n\n-30 playable levels\n-6 metalheads to chose from\n-designed for 2-4 people\n-local multiplayer\n-cartoony violence\n-incredible soundtrack",
