Hide from terrible creatures or confront them as you find your way through the challenges of this wicked world. \n\n· GYLT is a narrative adventure game with puzzles, stealth and action, set in a fictional old mining town in the state of Maine.\n\n· After being chased by a group of bullies, Sally is dragged into a twisted version of her town where her fears and worse memories are presented in a wicked and very real way.\n\n· Get to understand the world surrounding and discover the mystery behind Emily’s disappearance.\n\n· You can avoid being detected by creatures, you can build strategies to distract them, through sound or visual lures or by attracting them.\n\n· Decide to either face the creatures or hide from them, in the same way you’d face or hide your fears.\n\n· Music by Cris Velasco.",
