    "description": "Akama. A lone island, sitting in the middle of an endless ocean, and the site of a magical phenomenon known only as the Rift. It was once a source of limitless power for humanity, through magical creatures called the Ateyan. Capable of incredible and wonderful feats of magic, they lived alongside humanity for centuries - until something destroyed this harmony. The Ateyan disappeared, becoming motes of light on an almost deserted island. Human civilizations crumbled, its formerly great cities and industry reclaimed by nature. Generations passed in the shadow of ancient splendor. Then, something happened: The Rift began consuming the island, threatening the survival of humanity's remnants.\n\nMonster Tribe puts you in the shoes of humanity's last hope, a sage born with a natural connection to the Ateyan, capable of calling them forth from the void between the real world and the Rift.

Can the rift be stopped?\n\nCan a single human make a difference?\n\nIsland of Akama\n\nThe vast island has a long and terrible history. The disappearance of the Ateyan destroyed human civilization, leaving behind precious few survivors - and an endless array of secrets waiting to be discovered.\nAwaken the Ateyan!
