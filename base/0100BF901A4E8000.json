    "description": "Cubic Light is minimalistic puzzle game where you need to put blocks to activate the entire image.\nGrab the block, define the color if necessary, and put it into the correct place. You need to activate all the cells to complete the level.\n\nMeet a challenge every 5 levels â€“ you need to define the color of the blocks yourself.\n\nMind the color, number of cells and the direction of the blocks. The block should be of the same color that is the cell you place it on. Some blocks can be of no color (white) so you should color them before placing,\nIf you messed up you can always restart the level.\n\nFeatures:\n- 75 level\n- challenge every 5 levels\n- 4 colors\n- beautiful and relaxing atmosphere",
