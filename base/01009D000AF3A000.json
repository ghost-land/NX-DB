    "description": "\"Gelly Break Deluxe\" is a real passion project for us and the re-release of our fun first platformer \"Gelly Break\" developed for all ages. Three years after the initial release, we have fulfilled our dream, reclaimed the rights to the IP and are now publishing \"Gelly Break Deluxe\" as an indie developer and publisher on our own. \"Gelly Break Deluxe\" is nicer and bigger with a proper story and all the features and content we already wished for back then. Of course, we don't want to make fans of the game pay again, so everyone who already owns the original version of \"Gelly Break\" will get the new update.\n\nIn \"Gelly Break Deluxe\" you have to save the Gellies' home planet from the evil Evil Blob as Gel and Lee. As a team, you have to use all your abilities to survive against the ever-changing enemy types, because the challenging jump'n'run passages can only be mastered together with your partner. The switching mechanics, precise coordination and timing are essential to master the unique boss fights, following the popular gameplay principle \"easy to learn, hard to master\".  \n\nAfter the time of \"social distancing\", \"Gelly Break Deluxe\" is the perfect way to get back together with your loved ones. Whether with parents, kids or friends, \"Gelly Break Deluxe\" is the perfect couch co-op fun for players of all ages.   \n",
