Dance with one of your friends by your side!\n\nIf you own a Philips Hue smart lighting system, connect it to the game and turn your living room into a concert hall! Bring the fun to another level!\n\nIn this first version, you can play one track for free in the demo. 2-player local multiplayer is only available in the paid version.
