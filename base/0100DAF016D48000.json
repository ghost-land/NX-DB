Find out in a mystery that goes all the way to the topâ€¦\n\nProcedurally generated Blazes\nRespond to new fires in procedurally generated levels across forests, lavish hotels, trains and apartment blocks.\n\nRescue Trapped Civilians\nWhen Firegirl arrives on the scene, she only has a few minutes to save all the civilians caught in the blaze! Douse roaring flames, chop through obstacles and extinguish dastardly pyro-monsters, use your hose to boost your jumps and reach high places to rescue trapped survivors (and cats).\n\nRebuild the Firehouse\nHang out at the Firehouse between missions to upgrade your equipment and hire new staff. You'll need all the help you can't get to prepare for your next mission!",
