    "description": "Welcome to Aircraft Carrier Survival, a strategy game set in the merciless reality of World War II, where your prowess as a commander decides the fate of a naval behemoth.\n\nTake control of the aircraft carrier, its crew, officers and planes during WW2. Give an example of military prowess by choosing the right equipment, crew, and escort for the mission. Assign a crew and choose what your officers should focus on. Your ship has many stations to man, and proper management will be the key to executing your plan. \n\nYour damage control teams can handle fire outbreaks, torpedo strikes, hull flooding, enemy bombardment, airstrikes, and suicide attacks from enemy planes, but not all of them at once. Assess which threats need to be dealt with first in order to survive.\n\nUse maneuvers, aircraft, anti-aircraft turrets, and whatever else you can to survive the enemy attack. Make sure that any enemy who dares to attack you will end up in the depths of the Pacific.\n\nUse intel collected during recon missions to prepare pilots and aircraft for large operations. Target enemy land bases and even their entire fleets. Identify opponents before choosing attack directions and deciding the sequence of targets and maneuvers.\n\nWill you risk all lives on the vessel to save the one in need? Do you have what it takes to make a decision on the spot? No matter what, some sacrifices will be necessary and the only source of redemption is victory!",
