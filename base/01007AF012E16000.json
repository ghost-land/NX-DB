He soon finds, however, that his other classmates treat him like a social outcast, being the oldest at his school by far.

Over the course of a year, the two bond — first, as friends, and then as something more.\n\nFeatures:\n* Around 80,000 word kinetic story (approx 5-6 hours of reading)\n* Detailed background and character art\n* A custom OST\n* Daily messages from Kyouko, the story’s heroine\n* A cute single mother!",
