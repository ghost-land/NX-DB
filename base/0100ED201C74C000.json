    "description": "You are an airport controller and your task is to draw the correct route and land the plane safely on airfields.\n\nIt sounds simple, but various obstacles will interfere with you - bad weather conditions, other participants in the airspace and the landscape. Try to build a route so that during the flight the plane avoids collisions and successfully lands.\n\nMany different levels will not let you get bored, and difficult obstacles will force you to strain your attention and logic to the limit!\n\nKey features:\n• A real workout for the mind and mindfulness;\n• Lots of levels with different difficulty;\n• Many dangerous obstacles on your way;\n• Management with the Joy-Con™️ controllers;",
