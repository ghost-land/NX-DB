    "description": "      Zombie Dead Smasher is an action-packed game that puts you in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. As a lone survivor, your mission is to kill as many zombies as possible using your trusty gun. The zombies come in different types, some blow harmful gas, some throw stones, some attack you head-on, and some jump on you unawares. To survive, you need to be quick on your feet, aim accurately, and use your wits to outsmart the zombie hordes.\n    \n    The game has multiple levels, each with a different set of challenges and increasing difficulty. After completing a level, you earn money, which you can use to upgrade your gun or buy new, stronger ones from the store. With each upgrade, your gun becomes more powerful, allowing you to take down the zombies with ease.\n  \n    Zombie Dead Smasher has three modes of play, Easy, Medium, and Hard, with the latter including the night mode, which makes it even more challenging due to the limited visibility. The game is perfect for players who love a good zombie shooter and enjoy a challenge. ",
