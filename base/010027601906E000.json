    "description": "Starting from the Crucifixion of Christ, you play as a disciple of Christ and witness key events in the early Church. ‘Synaxarion: Acts Part 1’ takes place during a portion of the Biblical Book of Acts that is enriched with additional history and tradition from the Synaxarion. \n\nThe Synaxarion is a collection of Saints’ lives, which are celebrated each day of the year. They are a light that leads us to Christ in every generation, a living Gospel. The ministry and very life of Christ is worked out in the lives of the Saints, His faithful servants. They are the glory of the Church, the God-bearers on earth and in heaven. Most of the saints were unknown to the world, but the Grace of God made them known to the whole universe and to all the ages. Amen.",
