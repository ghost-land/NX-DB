    "description": "\"What would you do if you woke up locked in a dark room, with your hands covered in blood – your sister and mother massacred?      \n\nMADiSON is an immersive and terrifying first-person psychological horror game, featuring disturbing gameplay and an unsettling and compelling narrative.     \n\nWith the help of an ‘possessed’ instant camera, connect the human world with the beyond. Solve puzzles, explore your surroundings and most importantly, survive.     Throughout your journey you are haunted by MADiSON, the ghost of an evil murderer, who is forcing you to continue a gory ritual started decades ago and commit abominable acts.  She wants you to finish her sinister ceremony.   Do you have the strength to resist?    \n\nIt’s not just her that you need to worry about.  There is more than one evil entity in MADiSON and every character has a disturbing story that blends seamlessly into the main narrative.     Use the instant camera to survive this torture. Develop the photos you take manually and face the fear of unveiling the truth.    Search everything, pick up elements and interact with them to survive the entities. Randomly activated events and changing puzzles throughout the game assures a higher level of replayability as you get lost in this immersive and terrifying experience.     \n\nWatch every step you make and be careful not to attract any unwanted attention. You won’t be alone.\"\n",
