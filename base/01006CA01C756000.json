    "description": "What happens if an adventurer enters the dungeon? And if two adventurers meet? What monsters live in the sewers?...\n\nRPG Alchemy is a variation on the Alchemy genre, but instead of trying to connect water to sand and fire to air you will start with a basic adventurer and just as a basic mob... then the two meet and the fun begins. Discover nearly 200 unique team members, enemies, and locations. Try and see if you can defeat all the monsters. ",
