    "description": "Blast through waves of the evil cybernetic fish armada Dark Tide, and fight to take back the Solar System as the members of Team B.ARK: good boy Barker the Dog, Felicity the wise-cracking Cat, Lucio the overprotective Bear and cautious-but-quick Marv the Rabbit.\n\nDark Tide has taken over the Earth and are spreading their reign of terror into outer space! Hop in a mech for up to 4-player co-op as you battle through multiple galactic stages full of hand-animated characters and enemies.\n\nEach member of Team B.ARK has their own unlockable backstory and unique gameplay style to fit their fuzzy personality. Pilot a furry friend solo or fuse mech abilities with family and friends to unleash each character’s out-of-this-world Super Attack capable of completely clearing the screen of incoming enemy forces! \n\nFace-off against challenging boss battles as you go up against the likes of Spike the Narwhal, Vic the Sea Snake, and a whole slew of intimidating bad guys dead set on destroying you at all costs.\n\nWork as a team, but be sure to grab the most plutonium from defeated enemies to see how your high-score ranks against your fellow teammates.\n\nCan you defeat the Dark Tide before their deep-sea forces completely take over the Solar System?! Squad up and fight to take back the Earth in B.ARK!\n",
