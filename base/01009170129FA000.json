    "description": "One Line Coloring is a vibrant puzzle game about creating lively shapes that compose and fold into beautiful, themed dioramas. One Line Coloring offers a relaxing, creative experience built around lines that uncover charming objects. Inspired by classic, pen-and-paper game of connecting dots, One Line Coloring gives players an impression of actually drawing the full object, line by line. Some objects are easily recognizable as our everyday items, others need to be completed to reveal their true form.\n\nEach level offers a lined shape of an object, that players need to fill with colors by connecting different sections of the shape.
