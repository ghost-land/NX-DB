    "description": "Part Two of the MSPA Reader Saga.\n\nEmbark on a quest of epic importance in Pesterquest, a grimsical episodic visual novel adventure set in the darkly funny Homestuck / Hiveswap universe.\n\nCanon is looking a little messy, and it’s probably all your fault. Continue your visual novel adventure through the world of Homestuck! Insert yourself into the lives of beloved characters! Get dinner at Olive Garden!\n\nOver 14 volumes, you'll dive deeper into Homestuck lore and reconnect with up to 20 familiar friends in all-new stories about Homstuck’s classic cast of characters, both extra and terrestrial. \nContinue the friend-finding escapades of MSPA Reader from Hiveswap Friendsim, meeting and developing a relationship with a new character in each volume.\n\nThis new release for Nintendo Switch™ includes all 14 volumes of the episodic series. It is available for purchase either standalone or in the Pestersim bundle, bringing together both Hiveswap Friendsim and Pesterquest for the complete MSPA Reader Saga at a bargain price.",
