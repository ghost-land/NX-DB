    "description": "Minit Fun Racer is a peculiar little racing game with 100% of developer and Devolver's profits going directly to charity. Forever.\n\nHop on your scooter into the twisting traffic of the bustling city and the debris covered sands of the barren desert just in time to watch the sunset. Befriend your local shopkeeper, chase coins, hit big jumps, and accomplish fun goals along each lap until youâ€™ve seen it all!\n\nMinit Fun Racer is a collaboration between Kitty Calis, Jan Willem Nijman, Jukio Kallio & Dominik Johann.",
