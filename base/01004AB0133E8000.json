To that end, the organization has established a series of schools up and down the country. Mihama Academy, more-or-less left to rot after a major incident, has been bought over by SORD and given a new purpose as one such 'specialist training school'. Mihama now entrusts the misfit girls who attend it with guns and live ammunition. Paying their own safety no heed, these students are again and again plunged into dangerous extrajudicial missions—all for the good of the world. No matter how much life grinds them down, what future awaits these girls, who've themselves chosen the path of the gun?\n\nGameplay\nIt's a visual novel in which you don't need to make any choices, so you can enjoy the story like you would when watching a movie or reading a book.
