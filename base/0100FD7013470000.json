    "description": "ZANAC is a classic shooting game that made a name for itself in the gaming industry in 1986.\nThis mobile app version of the game recreates the original game, including hidden elements.\nThe game system has been rearranged to make it easier to play.\n\nIn addition, this title has been improved with the G-MODE archives.\nThe \"Arrange\" mode allows you to fly through the air more intensely and smoothly.\nThe game includes two modes: \"Arrange\" mode, which is more intense and smoother, and \"Original\" mode, where you can enjoy the nostalgic graphics of the time.\nThere are eight types of special weapons. Each weapon has its own unique characteristics, and the power of each weapon increases with successive attacks.\nThe thrill comes from the large number of bullets that the enemy attacks with. Use the special attacks to your advantage to defeat the final boss!\n\n■ About G-MODE Archives\nThe G-MODE Archives is a reissue project that faithfully recreates old feature phone games as they were back then.\n\nIn order to enjoy the app as it was back then, the web-connected menu, buttons, and keys have been transplanted, but some of them may not work.\nFor more information on the Nintendo Switch™ version, press + and - buttons and see the \"How to play\" in the PAUSE menu.\n\n■ ZANAC\nRelease Year 2005 (G-mode)\nSite \"Get!!
