    "description": "Having been at peace for only 15 years since the end of the Energi War, the kingdoms of Archleign and Ghalzabine are once again thrust onto center stage after a murder perpetrated by a clone comes to light.\nHoping the treaty signed to end the use of clones for conventional warfare has not been violated, a joint-investigative team is put together to find out the cause and bring those responsible to justice. However, the adventure appears to be far more volatile than anyone could have first imagined...\n\nEngage in intense 3D turn-based battles with beautifully rendered character visuals, vibrant Energi and Break Skills! Characters outside the party can cooperate in various ways through the use of Assists. Not to mention the rest of the huge content packed in one in the well-known RPG saga, immerse yourself in challenging subquests, arena battles, bosses around the world and more!",
