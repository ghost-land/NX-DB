    "description": "The Hero with a Thousand Arms has created a challenging game where multiple mini-games are running simultaneously on the screen, and the player needs to switch between them to operate. Meanwhile, the other games enter bullet time mode. Players need to carefully observe the status of each game and switch between them in a timely manner to prevent a game over, which is a significant test of their multitasking skills.\nThe game contains a total of 10 mini-games, each lasting about one minute. During gameplay, player can earn \"stars\" as rewards, and using stars in the game produces different special effects. Additionally, stars can be used like arcade game coins to restart mini-games that have ended in a game over. So, even though it may be challenging to handle multiple games at the same time, as long as players can continuously obtain star rewards, they will have the seeds to reignite the fire of victory, while also adding a certain level of strategy to the game.\nIn addition to the challenge mode and gallery mode (which allows player to play each mini-game individually), the game also comes with a level editor. Player can freely combine different mini-games to discover and challenge themselves with various interesting combinations.",
