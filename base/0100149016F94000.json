    "description": "Climb into the cockpit and pilot your red stunt plane as far and as fast as you can over a landscape of mountains, lakes, the big city, a bustling international airport, and more! Collect silver and gold stars along the way to earn points and make it up the tournament scoreboard, but be warned, the competition is tough. Don’t run out of fuel or crash too many times as you’ll be out of the competition – and don’t run out of time either! Also try completing the many achievements set in the tournament, including barrel rolling, trick flying, and even causing water and snow sprays! So strap yourself in and get ready for a fast, exciting, and fun flight into the wide blue yonder.",
