    "description": "Loretta is a housewife. Walter is a writer. Dragged from the glitz and glamor of 1940s New York City and thrust into a dilapidated farmhouse in the rural south, both are unsuccessful, struggling with their finances, and straining in their relationship. But when Loretta learns of her husband’s infidelity and a lucrative life insurance policy filed in his name, a grisly plan takes root. It is up to you to decide how far she should take it.\n\nBecome an accessory to Loretta’s crimes as she navigates a nightmare of her own creation. Engage with the locals through branching dialogue options, discover the right tools for putting an end to nosy neighbors, recover from the betrayal of a love gone wrong, and ultimately decide how Loretta’s story should end. Will you walk the high road and move on, or will you serve those who have wronged you their just desserts?\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nBranching paths and multiple endings allow for a custom experience and opportunity for replay. Decide Loretta’s fate and explore the possible outcomes that await her. Whose side will you take in this story without heroes?\n\nMeet a diverse cast of characters and figure out if they want to help you or hinder you. Make tenuous allegiances or cast old friendships aside at key opportunities as this twisted tale unfolds.\n\nSolve cryptic puzzles, dive deeper into Loretta's imperfect past, and discover how deep her desperation will go when it comes to reclaiming control of her life.\n\nConceptually inspired by film noir, Loretta also pays homage to some of the greatest minds in horror, including Andrew Wyeth, Stephen King, Vladimir Nabokov and Alfred Hitchcock.",
