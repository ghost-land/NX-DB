Let nothing stand in your way as you compete against your friends in a selection of completely destructible environments. \nChoose one of two game modes and adapt them to your liking to keep the game fresh for game after game after game! \n\nTWO THEMES, EIGHT MAPS\nPlay in a collection of eight maps in two completely unique themes!\nThe bright and colorful City Theme and a dark and spooky Victorian Theme. Each map offers unique opportunities for play, and plenty of things to destroy! \n\nFREE FOR ALL\nCompete to be the last dodgem driving in Free For All, a game mode  in which you knock other players into the water until only you are still on land. Don't take too long though, as the floor of the maps itself will start to destruct after some time! \n\nSPOTLIGHT \nChase the spotlight across the map, as long as you touch it, you gain points! Other players will try and knock you out of the light though, so be ready to defend your position! \n\nCUSTOM GAMES\nAdapt the game modes to your liking by setting different score caps, stock or time limits. \n\nSPLIT SCREEN & BOTS\nPlay with 1-4 players in split screen, or add bots to fill out the roster.
