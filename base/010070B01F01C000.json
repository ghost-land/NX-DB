    "description": "- Accumulate demonic energy and you will be able to transform into a demon and gain powerful power!\n- Choose from different random skills to build your combat style.\n- Challenge the powerful BOSS and save fallen humanity!\n\nIn modern society, people are increasingly focusing on entertainment, immersing themselves in the joy brought by material things and losing themselves. These fallen humans are punished by the Holy Spirit, turning into emotionless beings of obsession.\nThe devil survives by absorbing the corrupted faith of humans, but if humanity falls to the point of having no emotions, this will also affect the devil's intentions. Without a choice, as a demon, you must destroy the Holy Spirit behind the curse to save humanity.",
