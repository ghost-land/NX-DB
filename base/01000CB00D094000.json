    "description": "TIP OF THE ICEBERG\nThe game is designed in the \"action-reaction\" way and there are no obvious choices. Beat the game once and then be curious \"What if I would do it differently\". Sometimes it's not so obvious but from time to time you'll see huge differences. The smallest things can be the most rewarding.\n\nDARK, SAD AND DISTURBING WORLD\nVisit the place known from the previous chapters of the Bad Dream Series. Encounter well-known creatures in their new form, or find the way to erase them from your memory and turn this dream into the peaceful nap.\n\nFEATURES\n- a highly atmospheric world created with simple yet beautiful graphic design, and carefully selected sounds\n- non-linear gameplay with high replayability\n- hidden content for curious players\n- original soundtrack",
