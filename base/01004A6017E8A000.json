    "description": "The original Romancing SaGa -Minstrel Song- included many of the SaGa series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released.\nThe free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey.\nThis remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded HD graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the SaGa series.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n■Story\nThe gods created man and man created stories.\n\nThe primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias.\nIn ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach.\nAfter a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the Fatestones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.\nNow 1000 years have passed since that titanic battle.\n\nThe Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more.\nEight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate.\n\nWhat tales will these adventurers weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias?\nYou are the only one who can decide!\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n▷New Elements\nIn addition to a full HD graphical upgrade, various new features expand the gameplay even further.\n\n■The sorceress Aldora can now be recruited!\nThe sorceress Aldora, who once traveled together with the legendary hero Mirsa, appears in her original form.
