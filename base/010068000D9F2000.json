Set in the Fading Suns Universe, where the suns themselves are dying, humanity battles to revive its lost greatness, or just take what is left. The five great Royal Houses dominate human space as they battle each other for control of the greatest resource... humanity itself.\n\nIn Noble Armada: Lost Worlds, players take on the role of a noble in one of the five Royal houses, vying against rival fleets and houses for control of human space. They battle pirates, barbarians, heretics and others in their quest for supremacy. Noble Armada is a game of broadsides and boarding actions, as players maneuver their ships to line up their best shots, fire off broadsides of fiery energy and then board their enemies to end the battle with desperate boarding actions. As they travel from planet to planet, making allies and building up their fleets, they also gain the experience they need to make their crews and marines truly formidable.",
