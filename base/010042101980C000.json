    "description": "Character sprites are made using the E-mote animation system.\nWhen they breathe, wink, or speak, it all looks very realistic.\nMoreover, 2 theme songs sung by Haruka Shimotsuki and Akira Ouse are included!\nEach character’s lines are fully dubbed in Japanese. \n\n\"Change your destiny. Impossible is a word to be found only in the dictionary of fools.\"\n\nShoichi Sakikawa was a normal, second-year high school student.\nOr, he was, until he woke up from a car accident only to find\nhimself trapped in mid-revolution 19th century France.\nWhat saved him from an onslaught of bullets was a girl armed with a sword.\n“I am Napoleon Bonaparte. And one day I shall be ruler of all France.”\nHaving been saved by this \"Napoleon\" in the form of a girl,\nShoichi ends up accompanying her on her quest.\nBut in this world, not only is the past distorted,\nbut the gods grant chosen girls the gift of greatness,\nwho in turn fight one another using superhuman abilities known as \"Apocalypse.\"\n\nWill Shoichi be able to return to his own world?\nAnd what will become of his growing bond with Napoleon?\n\nOpening Theme Song\n「Divine Akashic」\nComposer/Arranger/Lyrics/Singer\nAkira Ouse\n\nEnding Theme Song\n「命の唄 (Song Of Life)」\nSinger: Haruka Shimotsuki\nComposer/Arranger: Takumaru\nLyrics: Daiai Aoi",
