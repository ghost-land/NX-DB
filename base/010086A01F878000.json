    "description": "Get soothed by extremely cute cat photos while easily training your brain with this spot-the-difference game.\n\nHow to play is simple:\n・Carefully observe the photo on the ‘top’ of the split screen.\n・Identify the differences in the ‘bottom’ photo, which is flipped, compared to the top photo.\n・Once you find a discrepancy, touch that spot!\n\nIt might seem straightforward when you know the answer, but the flipped images add a surprising level of difficulty. It’s perfect for quick play and passing time.\n\nPress the hint button only when you’re truly stumped! (We’ll provide a big hint that almost gives it away).\n\nThe game supports both button controls and touch controls, allowing you to play in TV mode, handheld mode, or tabletop mode.\n※This game is designed to be played on the Nintendo Switch™ in vertical orientation.",
