    "description": "In Bohemian Killing the gameplay mechanics are based on the concept of two tightly interconnected timelines. The game offers a massive number of opportunities and ways by which the player can try to prove the protagonist's innocence. For example, the player can lie, support their testimony with additional evidence or even pretend to be insane in order to clear the protagonist of charges. The way of achieving the goal here depends exclusively on the player's imagination and tactics they apply. Thus, each playthrough can be completely different. The game features a dozen of regular endings plus a hidden one.",
