If you are swallowed by the darkness, it's game over. You cannot turn back.\n\nThe screen will continue to scroll right even while shopping or fighting enemies.

See if you can overcome the challenges of this one way adventure.\n\nFeatures:\n・A definitive edition, including features from both One Way Heroics and One Way Heroics Plus, brought to Nintendo Switch™.\n・Controls optimized for Nintendo Switch.\n・Eleven classes to choose from for your player character.\n・Allies and NPC's which aid your character.\n・Over 260 items.\n・9 different endings.\n・Replay function to play back your adventures.",
