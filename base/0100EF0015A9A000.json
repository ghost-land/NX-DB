    "description": "Record of Lodoss War -Deedlit in Wonder Labyrinth- is a 2D action-exploration \"Metroidvania\"-style game developed under the close supervision of original creator Ryo Mizuno, depicting the previously unknown story of Deedlit and the events leading up to Record of Lodoss War: Diadem of the Covenant.\n\nBoth fans of Record of Lodoss War and all-new players alike can fully enjoy this latest installment in the series.\n\n■ Story\nDeedlit awakens suddenly in a mysterious, unknown place.\nWhere am I? Why am I here?\n\nWith nobody around to respond, her questions are met with only silence.\n\nSeeking answers, Deed eventually sets off on foot, alone…\n\n■ Game Features\nSword and Arrow Attacks:\nUse your sword for powerful melee attacks against enemies within range, or employ projectile attacks using your bow and arrows against those farther away.\n\nSwappable Equipment:\nFreely equip and utilize swords and arrows obtained along the way. The powerful weapons and tools you acquire can be used to your advantage throughout your journey. You can also sell off weapons you no longer need.\n\nSwappable Elemental Spirits:\nAlternate among a selection of useful elemental spirits to change Deedlit’s various attributes. While using Sylph, the wind spirit, wind-based attacks do less damage. When the flame spirit Salamander is in use, fire-based attacks do less damage.\n\nRaise Elemental Spirit Levels:\nYou can raise the levels of your elemental spirits by absorbing the “Soul Screams” generated when attacking and defeating enemies.\n\nEach spirit’s level is displayed as Deed’s own power level. When a spirit’s level has maxed out at 3, HP will be automatically recovered.",
