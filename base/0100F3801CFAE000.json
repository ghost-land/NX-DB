    "description": "Eldgear is a tactical strategy RPG set in a fantasy world.\n\nIn the vast unexplored land of Argenia where hundreds of nations are crowded together, a new era is about to begin, leaving behind the medieval era and entering the era of magical civilization.\n\nIn turn-based battles, you can choose your own strategy, whether you dash alone like lightning, advance steadily like the earth. Immersive and enjoyable pixel animations take place to enhance the battle experience.\n\nMaster area attacks that blow away enemies in a group, combined attacks unleashed by well-coordinated tags, and use EMA (Embedding Abilities) and EXA (Expanding Abilities)! Powerful strikes will power up into super special moves.",
