    "description": "Is magical kingdom doomed, having only Wizard Mike as its protector? Yes. Most likely.\n\nBut there’s a chance, small one but still – Mike might not be the smartest guy in the room. Maybe he failed alchemy classes 17 times in a row. Maybe he almost destroyed the entire University of Magic causing an explosion during the potions class. But he doesn’t lack self-confidence! He just needs your help. Guide him through the battle with evil forces and save the kingdom!\n\n\nWizard Mike is an insanely addictive logic game.\n\n- Avoid traps set by your enemies\n\n- Use all your brainpower to solve puzzles\n\n- Use your magic wand to get rid of the enemies!\n\n\nBut the enemies aren’t stupid (they only look like that) and they defend themselves as much as they can – you must use your brain and also logic to pass all levels of this cool adventure game. On your way, you will run into various obstacles – bombs, traps or even… knights – but remember that every weapon can be a double-edged sword.\n\n\nAlso, keep in mind that you are not alone in this war – you have your brave wand at your service, which can turn your opponents into dust. In some levels, you will appreciate your Magic Potion Travel Kit.\n\n\nMike is still a teenager so he cares about his look and fashion style – you have a ton of clothes, hats and even wings to change style of your cool wizard to even cooler wee-zharrd. This could help you to shock your opponents even before the battle!",
