    "description": "Paradox Soul is an exploration based, survival Metroidvania that takes hand holding and throws it out of the window. Instead of spelling everything out for the player, the only way for Dr. Alli Rose to figure out what’s going on in a peculiar test facility, is to descend deeper down the rabbit hole and figure it all out by herself.\n\nNo one is going to save her from this test facility, so help Dr. Rose collect every up-grade, defeat every boss and solve the mystery while you can. You are her only hope.\n\nFeatures: \n * Retro pixel art and animation\n * Terrifyingly epic boss fights\n * Unique suit abilities for combat and navigation\n * Cool weaponry upgrades to discover\n * Hand-crafted labyrinth of evil\n * Secrets to unravel",
