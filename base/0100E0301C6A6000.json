    "description": "A peaceful dungeon crawling adventure, no twitchy reflexes needed, this game can be played at your own pace. \n\nSir Questionnaire is a turn-based hack’n’slash game, where you enter a dungeon and each room gives you two options: leave the room, or interact with what ever is in the room. This can be monsters, gates, treasure chests, pools of water, but also debris, or just another door!\n\nA game designed around the simple premise of adventuring: go west or go east? Every room you enter will give you a choice, either stay and fight the dragon, or turn your back and rush to the next room. If you have the right gear, you might be able to slay the dragon.. if you rush away, you might feel it’s warm fiery breath hitting you in the back.\n\nMake the right choice, use your inventory to gain the upper hand in any room, and move deeper into the dungeon!\n",
