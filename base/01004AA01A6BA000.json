    "description": "If you were to mix Factorio, Forager, and Satisfactory, Nova Lands would be just that. Explore, build, and automate your base in this awesome, open-world 2D game!\n\nBASE BUILDING\nNew planet, new home. Build your new base with all sorts of resources available to you, from basic rocks and wood to rare and unknown materials. Unlock new possibilities with every new building, maximize efficiency, and push deeper to other islands.\n\nAUTOMATION\nAs you progress through the game, you will be able to automate more and more things, freeing up more time to explore! Your little helper bots will be instrumental in helping you do that.\n\nWHAT ARE THE BOTS?\nThe bots are the tipping point where your ingenuity will begin to shine. These little self-sufficient machines can form entire production chains and sustain your industry all on its own. They’re easy to set up and manage.\n\nTHE ISLANDS AND EXPLORATION\nJust like you’re not the only person to land on this planet, your started island is one of many! Kickstart your industry to get all the tech you need and comfortably explore other islands. You’ll come across various biomes, creatures, landmarks, caves, and some really important people…\n\nCOMBAT\nOf course, there’s a blaster you can fire, and critters large enough to be a real menace! Engage in combat and gather rare materials, or, go the full pacifist route and remain a kind guest to this planet - even when boss creatures are concerned. Be prepared to offer valuables to make peace with them, however.",
