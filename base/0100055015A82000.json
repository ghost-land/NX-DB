    "description": "Sleep has the power to transport us to wonderfully enigmatic places, sometimes frightening and often unexpected. Lucid Cycle is an exploration of the concepts and experiences common to our dreams, whether it’s solving environmental puzzles without a clear purpose or journeying through a shifting landscape without knowing the final destination. Sometimes we might find ourselves in familiar places with unfamiliar circumstances or vice versa, but is there a greater meaning behind it all?\n\nPresented in a first-person perspective, Lucid Cycle casts you as the dreamer, exploring a series of short yet vivid scenarios. Make sense of each to transport yourself to the next scene. You may need to locate a hidden object, leap across platforms suspended in space or retrace your steps to find your way forward. None of these vignettes are the same, but they’re all paint on the same tapestry.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Journey through a series of beautifully crafted ethereal scenarios.\n• Explore fully 3D environments from a first-person perspective.\n• Solve puzzles and overcome light platforming sequences.\n• Locate objects hidden in trippy locations!\n• Enjoy a soothing casual experience without fear of death or failure.",
