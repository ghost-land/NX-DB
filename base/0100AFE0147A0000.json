    "description": "It’s a new, dark and machine-filled Edo period, and the Shogunate rules over Japan with its just, but pitiless hand: you.\n\nYou follow orders. You obey. You kill.\n\nUntil your sight is taken from you, and you must learn to “feel” the world anew...\n— A world of data and lies\nThe Mask of the Oni creates a simulation of the world around you, but tread carefully: old data will show you only deceiving echoes of the past.\n\n— Swords sing unseen\nEven blind, you are unstoppable. Use different sensors to detect your enemies and identify their weak spots, then crush them with lightning speed.\n\n— Robotic folktales of Japan\nDiscover the story of dozens of robotic versions of Japanese folktale creatures! Find their weaknesses and destroy each one with a devastating finisher!\n\n— Long-lost mechanical lore\nYour sensors pierce the curtain of the past. Use sound, smell and heat to explore the world, uncovering centuries of lore and guiding Yami on his vengeful, story-driven journey.",
