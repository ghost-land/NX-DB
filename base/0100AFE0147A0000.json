Use different sensors to detect your enemies and identify their weak spots, then crush them with lightning speed.\n\n— Robotic folktales of Japan\nDiscover the story of dozens of robotic versions of Japanese folktale creatures! Find their weaknesses and destroy each one with a devastating finisher!\n\n— Long-lost mechanical lore\nYour sensors pierce the curtain of the past.
