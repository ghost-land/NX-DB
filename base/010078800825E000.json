    "description": "Wanderjahr is a compact RPG with real-time strategy combat and an intriguing story. This universe, this reality, there’s a source code behind all of it. We’d know. We’ve already found it. And, with it, we will cleanse this reality of all evil. \nFor centuries the entirety of humanity has been working to edit the universe source code. And now this impossibility seems so close to becoming reality. But then they come. Monstrous creatures pour from every corner of the world, bringing with them chaos. Is this the final test of our mettle?\n",
