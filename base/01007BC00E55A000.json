While sleepless warriors roam the halls with their minds eroded by eternity, a lone Awakewalker emerges from cryosleep. With no memory of their past, it’s up to them to forge their future, discover the planet’s mysteries, and find a way out of this icy hell.\n\nSouls-like Progression: \nRecover Experiences lost upon death and use them to upgrade your character.
