    "description": "Attention! This is part of the \"Ninja JaJaMaru: The Great Yokai Batlle +Hell Deluxe Edition\"\n\nIn the 80s and early 90s, the “Super Ninja-kid” series was one of Jaleco’s most prolific franchises, with several highly successful games. \n\nThe Retro Collection contains 5 of the most important platform evergreen games: Starting with “Ninja JaJaMaru-kun“ (1985, NES™), on to \"Super Ninja-kid“  (1994, Super NES™).\n\n„Restored with love“ is invariably our motto at ININ, but this time it is particularly applicable to \"Ninja JaJaMaru: The Great World Adventure“ a Game Boy™ title from 1990 that sees the light of day in colour for the first time ever! It runs perfectly on modern consoles – and is included in this Retro Collection!\n\nOver the decades, there have been several attempts to bring single games from the series to Western audiences as well. Now, for the very first time, the most important and legendary games in this series are available to all international fans!\n",
