    "description": "CLOSER - anagnorisis is a creative adventure game.\n\nThis is a game with distinctive art and gameplay. It contains a lot of creative designs.\n\nThe game tries to make it interesting without fighting. Players need to think about how to accomplish by \"winning by cleverness\".\n\nEach section of the game will have a different experience and gameplay, so that players can experience freshness in every part, and can think about emotional cues of the current mood of the character.\n\nThroughout the game, players need to avoid crisis brought by the enemy, and use some knowledge to deal with the challenges of solving puzzles.\n\nI hope that through this game, everyone will care for those people whose hearts have been traumatized.",
