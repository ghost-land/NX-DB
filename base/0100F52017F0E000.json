Sounds easy? There are big bad aliens along the way, and their bigger, badder bosses. There are puzzles and special objectives, from cranking carts to demolishing doom towers. And you also have to evacuate!\n\nMeet a worthy challenge in mission-based campaigns that end with boss encounters. \n\n\nArm up and find your playstyle\n\nDo you prefer melee or ranged combat? Will you rely on basic attacks or special moves? Are you a defensive player, or a Leeroy Jenkins? Decide and jump straight into the action, solo or with friends. \n\nWreck hundreds of enemies. Deactivate force fields. Set up explosives. Or even go… fishing?! Do everything it takes to liberate the planet. And don’t forget to evacuate once your mission is complete!\n\n\nUnlock tons of parts & cosmetics\n\nPut the style in playstyle! Level up and unlock TONS of new gadgets, from weapons to special devices to cosmetics. Make your Robo yours, and only yours. \n\nUnlock new stuff for being a fighter, not for microtran-- Bleh!
