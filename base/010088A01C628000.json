    "description": "Explore the world, find Crystals, and fulfill the prophecy to bring balance to the land of Sequoia.\n\n...Or maybe you'd rather spend your time collecting neat equipment and artifacts? Or tame strange creatures and fill out all the entries in your archive? Or perhaps you'd rather hunt down every monster and conquer the world's toughest bosses. Or maybe you'd rather travel to the farthest reaches of the land and uncover the world's greatest mysteries.\n\nThe choice is yours, as it should be! Or is it? They say that those who stray out of line will be punished, killed, or worse. Maybe it's for your own good that you stick to collecting Crystals, just like everyone else. But where would the adventure be in that?\n\nTactical Battles:\n- No random encounters!\n- Manage Threat to control which party member a monster will attack.\n- No hidden information.
