    "description": "Place pieces, paint the board, make music. Chime Sharp is a sequel to 2009's Chime, a music puzzle game with an addictive, ambient heartbeat. You join shapes to cover a grid, while a beatline reads those shapes as notes. As you cover the board, the music builds to a beautiful crescendo of your own design. The only way to discover Chime is to play it, but if you want a glimpse, consider what it might feel like to cross Tetris, a music sequencer and a hypnotic dream about your favourite pop song.",
