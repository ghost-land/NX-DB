The result is an immense sense of accomplishment in completing each level.\n\nEnjoy a minimalist story surrounding an alien who’s on his way home from a factory job when his ship malfunctions and crash-lands on a planet filled with lethal hazards. Can you help him survive the journey home?\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Navigate deadly traps and pitfalls across 40 pixel art levels.\n• Keep trying as the cruel death counter tracks your failed attempts!\n• Switch to easy difficulty if things get too maddening.\n• Experience the reward of overcoming a classic challenge!\n",
