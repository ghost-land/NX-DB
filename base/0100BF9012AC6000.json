    "description": "Suguru Nature is a great logic puzzle with two simple rules.\n\nThe cells in each puzzle grid are divided into groups, and each group contains the numbers from 1 to N, where N is the number of cells in the group. Thus, a group containing 5 cells will contain numbers from 1 to 5. The second rule is that no two adjacent cells, including diagonal, can contain the same number.\n\n- 90 puzzles, Easy/Medium/Hard\n- Minimal UI with beautiful backgrounds\n- Relaxing music",
