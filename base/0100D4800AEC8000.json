    "description": "City Builder combines two classic game mechanics in a fun, bouncy new game where players stack pipes, roads and power lines to form ever-larger cities, moving from one to the next across the planet’s continents.\nAlong the way, they run into a large number of challenges, ranging from clever/pesky Mole-men to the elusive Bigfoot, Aliens, Wandering Hot-Air Balloons, Huge Bonus Levels and much more.\n\nAs addicting as it is fun, City Builder offers over 20 hours of non-stop gameplay to a pro – a casual player usually requires 2x that or more – that’s up to 40 hours or more of gameplay to a casual player!",
