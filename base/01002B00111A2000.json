Learn more about Zelda, the four Champions, the King of Hyrule and more through dramatic cutscenes as they try to save the kingdom from Calamity. The Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity game is the only way to see firsthand what happened 100 years ago.\n\n- Battle hordes of Hyrule’s most formidable foes -\n\nFrom barbaric Bokoblins to towering Lynels, menacing monsters have emerged in droves. In addition to Link and Zelda, take control of characters like the four Champions and a young Impa. Use their distinct abilities to carve through hundreds of enemies to save Hyrule from the impending Calamity.\n\n\nIf you have save data for the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild game, you can get the in-game Training Sword bonus item. Equip this weapon and you’ll automatically hold a Pot Lid as a shield. This combo may also trigger the occasional Perfect Guard!\n",
