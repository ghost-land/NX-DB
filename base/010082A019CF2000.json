Among the soldiers, there’s our hero in shining armor, whose name is Swordbreaker. He has to either win with everyone or suffer a shameful defeat and condemn the whole kingdom to extermination.\nBut all this will happen a bit later...\n\nAs for now, the young adventurer lives a peaceful life and can’t even imagine what is waiting for him ahead... Strange events take place in the territory of the kingdom of Dorgan.

All this will depend only on the player...\n\nFeatures:\n- Nonlinear story\n- 8 incredible endings of the game\n- The vast expanses of the kingdom to explore\n- Many interesting places and situations\n- Beautiful comic illustrations\n- Mini games",
