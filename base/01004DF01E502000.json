    "description": "Let's escape from the endlessly repeating Line 2 of the subway!\nWe've created an anomaly with the unique free thinking of students! Enjoy!\n\n【Please note】\n\nThere is a slight horror element in this train. Please give up your seat to all passengers, including the elderly, those who are uncomfortable with fear, pregnant women, and those with infants.\nThe next stop is Line 2. The anomaly, escape, puzzle-solving, and slight horror elements require a transfer. The exit is the C7 exit ahead.\nPlease watch your step as there are gaps between the world and the platform.\n【Game Description】\n\nUse it without missing any anomalies.\nIf you find an anomaly, immediately turn back and head to the opposite exit.\nIf no anomaly is found, continue along the path.\nExit from the C7 exit.\n\n【Estimated playtime】\n15 minutes to 120 minutes",
