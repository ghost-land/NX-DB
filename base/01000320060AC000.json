    "description": "Take command of HEROCORP™ and launch a Preemptive Defense Campaign™ against parallel dimensions in OTTTD, the most outrageous Tower Defense title.\n\nOTTTD stands for Over The Top Tower Defense, and you'll see why when you're blasting 9 kinds of hell out of a floating robot shark that's making a beeline for your HQ. \n\nYou play as a commander for HEROCORP™, the 4th largest private military organization in the galaxy. \n\nYour job is to “preemptively defend” the Earth against alien dimensions BEFORE they attack Earth. Make sure to come in under budget and fill out the TPS reports in triplicate!\n\nIs \"preemptively defending Earth\" ethical? It doesn't matter, your responsibility is to the shareholders!\n\nFeatures \n• Deep RPG Mechanics\nChoose from 7 unique hero classes to make up your squad of 3. The more action they see the more XP they earn to level them up through custom skill trees.\n• 30+ active abilities\n• 40+ passive skills\n• Multiple armor options with stats to suit your play-style\n\n• You want billions of weapons?\nWell we dont have that many but... we've put a lot of work balancing the the 30+ we do have along with 12 tower types and 6 different damage types.  \n\nWe're sure HEROCORP™ has got the hardware to ensure you can wreak havoc in your own personal style. \n\n• More enemies than you can poke a boom stick at \nThe range of enemies in OTTTD is wide enough to soothe even the itchiest trigger finger. Floating eyeballs? Check. Gunclams? You know it. Giant Wartoises? Of course. And we're pretty sure we are the ONLY game with a motorcycle riding squid in it.\n\nMATURE CONTENT DESCRIPTION\nThe game contains lots of gibs and blood from enemies",
