    "description": "Transcelation is a flashy abstract action game that will expand your language skills and vocabulary while you navigate colorful, ever-changing worlds to the sound of rousing electronic beats. The game is a combination of a classic arcade feel and gamified learning techniques - it makes mastering new words feel like going out clubbing and staying in to play video games at the same time. You won’t even notice you’re learning! \n\nEnjoy the fast-paced action while the game challenges you to associate and memorize new words from the language of your choosing. \n\nJust pick a language you know and pair it with some you don't. Choose from: English, Spanish, French, German, Simplified Chinese, Russian, Polish or even... morse code! \n\nOr - if you're not in the mood for learning - launch Arcade Mode just for fun and score wicked combos as neon lights and electronic trance music incite your senses. \n\nBecome a Trancelator today!",
