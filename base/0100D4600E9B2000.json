Players take control of a space Cadillac and frag their way to victory against friends or can also play against AI. Both modes allow players to unlock a full crew roster. Submachine guns, sniper rifles, frag grenades, homing missiles, and bullet deflectors are just some of the tools player can use to create havoc.",
