    "description": "FEATURES:\n▪ Psychological horror set in a lucid dream, relying on slow build and creepy atmosphere rather than gore and violence.\n▪ Unique artstyle and detailed environment to explore.\n▪ Sound design by Bjørn Jacobsen, known for his work on such games as Cyberpunk 2077 and Hitman.\n▪ Puzzles that involve bending the laws of physics (walking on walls and ceilings) , manipulating the dream world (moving things, rotating rooms), collecting and using found objects, and avoiding enemies.\n▪ Hidden secrets to find (optional, for hardcore players only).\n\nDARQ will take you on a journey through Lloyd's dreams that quickly turn into a loop of nightmares. The boy’s main priority is to wake up, but unfortunately, each attempt sinks him deeper into his lucid subconscious-driven dreams. Lloyd has to adapt to the new world, re-learn gravity, strain all of his senses and mind in order to solve puzzles and sneak past the creatures guarding the corners of DARQ.\n\nWill you decipher the true meaning of Lloyd’s dreams?\n\nDARQ Ultimate Edition includes: \n1) DARQ - Original Game.\n2) The Tower DLC - Lloyd wakes up in his dreams again only to find himself in a Tower filled with many new mysteries, puzzles, and creepy creatures. \n3) The Crypt DLC - Another loop of nightmares continues introducing new mechanics and puzzles in a crypt filled with dark surprises.\n4) DARQ: Dream Journal: a 60-page graphic novel based on the award-winning video game DARQ. The comic sheds light on the events shown in the game and significantly expands upon the DARQ universe.\nWhat is DARQ? What was the meaning of the game's ending? What happened to Lloyd and why was he stuck in a dream? This comic answers all of these questions, and more.",
