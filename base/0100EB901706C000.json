    "description": "Two brothers are lost in the dark and grim woods, and they accidentally stumble across the abandoned circus. Suddenly they are both attacked by a group of crazed clowns, and one of the brothers got captured. There's only way to get out of troubles for the second boy — to escape the damned woods and call the police, right? Nope, wrong — you see, our hero is not the sharpest tool in the shed. That's why he decides to save his brother on his own, and travels deep into the woods where he would only find grave danger and inevitable coulrophobia.",
