    "description": "The small country of Arpéchéle is surrounded by the sea and filled with black flowers known as Lycoris Noirges. Every island resident is cursed to die at the age of 23. \n\nMany years of research have led to the creation of a “memory download” system, allowing the body to die while memories live on in a clone known as a “Reliver”.\n\nThe original story of Virche Evermore -ErroR: Salvation- followed a girl known as “Death” who brought an early end to any person she was involved with. With the assistance of others, she was able to discover the truth behind some of the dark workings on the island.\n\nThis fan disk allows you to explore five unique, all-new tales.",
