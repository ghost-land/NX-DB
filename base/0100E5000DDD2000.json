    "description": "Unforgiving and tense, each mission tells a story of two police operatives - John Rimes and Rick Jones, filled with infiltrating gang hideouts, rescuing hostages, making arrests and other life-threatening situations.\n\nFeatures:\n\n– The Surrender System allows you to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence. Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.\n\n– Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return. \n\n– Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.\n\n– As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.\n\n– Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.\n\n– Complex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.\n\n– All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!\n\n– Local Co-op. Complete missions together for better scores and more fun!",
