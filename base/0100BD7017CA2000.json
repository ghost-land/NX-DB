    "description": "Talismans are magical items that contain great power, even with some that can grant any desire. Kronos, a boy training as a wizard, and Serene, who consider one another as siblings, become enveloped in a Talisman conspiracy. Will they be able to save themselves and the world from the threatening danger?\n\nEquip Talismans to the Skill Board to acquire skills and fatal moves to turn the tides in turn-based battles. Forging and upgrading weapons, armor and Talismans from materials will grant you additional advantages. There are also strategic elements with battle formations and traps, and not to mention the variety of quests, arena and monster achievements that await as challenges in this fantasy RPG!",
