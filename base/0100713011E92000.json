Choose your perfect date-night bowling experience from a variety of customizable options:\n\n• Pick your player and your date from a rich cast of characters with their own special chemistries (or lack thereof…)\n• Choose to bowl solo, pair up with an AI partner, or even face off against your friends with a local 2-player match\n• Make your own challenge by choosing your ball weight, lane oil, and overall difficulty levels\n• Two bowling alleys, each with their own late-night vibe and groovy original music\n\nImpress Your Date with All Manner of Skills\n\nEveryone loves an ace bowler (or so we’re told), but nothing melts hearts quite like winning the cutest toy from the claw machine.
