    "description": "Enter the wacky & whimsical world of Uurnog Uurnlimited, where you have only one goal: find your way around the world, and steal all the animals! Why? \n\nBecause they’re adorable, and because video games.\n\nUurnog Uurnlimited is a delightfully silly 2D platformer inspired by games like Super Mario Bros. 2, Lyle in Cube Sector, and Dyad. Play single-player or co-op, explore the world through its many mysterious doors, solve puzzles and gather the items and animals needed in your Save Room. Careful though — the Save Room also saves your mistakes (urr nurr!)\n\nWhat else does it have, you ask? Chaotic neutral NPCs that can mess with your game! Algorithmic music that adapts to the gameplay! \n\nIt's uurnbelievable! It's uurnexplainable! It's Uurnog Uurnlimited!\n\nKey Featuurnes:\n•\tCLASSIC 2D PUZZLE PLATFORMER: Solve puzzles and collect animals, then bring them back to your Save Room.\n•\tCHALLENGING BOSS FIGHTS: Survive long enough and you may even meet the Uurnog!\n•\tSWEET ALGORITHMIC MUSIC: Adapts the melody, tempo, key, and more to the gameplay.\n•\tPLAY SOLO OR SHARED SCREEN CO-OP: Real talk: everything is better when you’re playing with a friend as an adorable puppy, right?\n•\tMULTIPLE ENDINGS: Shhhh. I hear there may even be some secrets to discover… ;)",
