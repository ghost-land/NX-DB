    "description": "Jump rope virtually and watch the on-screen counter increase with each successful hop! Another player can join in on the fun with another Joy-Con™ controller as you strive for a high score.\n\nBy using a pair of Joy-Con controllers and imagining them as the handles of a jump rope, players can virtually jump rope every day. With hopping bunnies as the characters, simple menus and no long tutorials to jump through, it’s quick and easy to learn the ropes. You can even skip in style with a number of outfits and backgrounds!\n\nFor those who aren’t able to jump, or are worried about disturbing the downstairs neighbors, players can bend their knees or move their arms to play the game without creating any noise. \n\nJump Rope Challenge was created by a small group of Nintendo developers while working from home in Japan as a simple game to add some quick and fun movement into their daily lives.\n\nMake sure to stretch properly before play. Game play requires varying amounts of physical activity. \n\nConsult a doctor before playing if: \n・you are or may be pregnant, \n・you have heart, respiratory, back, joint or other orthopedic conditions, \n・you have high blood pressure, \n・you have difficulty with physical exercise or you have been instructed to restrict physical activity. \n \nIf you experience excessive fatigue, shortness of breath, chest tightness, dizziness, discomfort or pain while playing STOP USE IMMEDIATELY and consult a doctor. Keep your activity within reasonable limits and avoid excessive exertion. \n\n*Not compatible with Nintendo Switch Lite\n**Jump Rope Challenge was developed using Unity, a real-time development platform.",
