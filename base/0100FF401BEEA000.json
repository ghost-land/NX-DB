    "description": "Over 40 years since its arcade debut, Quantum: Recharged warps the classic arcade title with modern flourishes that have become a staple among the Recharged series. Defeat waves of enemies using your ship to circle around them and create a punishing deadzone. By removing the traditional ability to shoot enemies, this title challenges players to avoid taking damage and progress through increasingly difficult levels. \n\nThis Recharged release expands on the classic gameplay with a wider variety of deadly enemies and some new moves to even the odds. Accelerate to make some distance between you and a stalking Neutron and use your dodge to avoid the Quarks’ deadly laser attacks. With two modes of play, you can chase for high scores in both the endless arcade mode or 25 curated levels designed to push your reflexes to the limits. \n\nAnd, of course, it wouldn’t be a Recharged title without some new beats from Megan McDuffee. Hear the music build in real time as your combo multiplier grows higher and higher. Try not to get hit! \n\nArcade Mode:\nSurvive as long as you can against progressively dangerous enemies until you’re out of lives.\n\nChallenge Mode:\n25 hand-crafted levels with unique challenges such as defeating a certain number of enemies within a period of time, each designed to make you think of new strategies to conquer them.\n\nPower Ups:\nUnlimited dodges, freezing enemies, and the critical extra life will spawn to help you turn the tables on your enemies.\n\nLocal Co-op:\nCover more ground with a friend across all modes of play to strategically clear out enemies in tandem.\n\nLeaderboards:\nCompete in global leaderboards in arcade and challenge modes",
