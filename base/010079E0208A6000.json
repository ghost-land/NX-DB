    "description": "Long ago, the Stenian race lived in harmony on the planet Xelarvis, aided by their mechas. However, everything changed when the Kaxeder race arrived. They invaded the world with the intent to destroy and conquer it. The Stenian army was defeated, forcing them to flee and take refuge in an ancient settlement in the frozen region. Hope seemed lost when the adversary began occupying the frozen areaâ€”lost, that is, except for a single Stenian pilot who fought back, even if he was alone.\n\nDespite being on his own, the Stenian pilot repelled the Kaxeder army and destroyed the technology's generators responsible for depleting the planet's life. Upon discovering the pilot's location, Kaxeder Headquarters is now acting swiftly to halt his rampage.\n\nAfter several months, the Stenian pilot reached the Kaxeder settlement in the frost region. The settlement was heavily guarded in an attempt to thwart the arrival of the last Titan Mecha of the Stenian race.\n\nNow, all Stenian hope rests on this pilot.\nThis pilot is you!\n\nYou'll have to destroy enemy mechas and objectives like fuel tanks, generators, atomic reactors, and enemy cores in intense 3D battles with deep sci-fi atmospheres and immersive soundscapes. To aid you, you'll be able to select different mechas and tune their equipment.\n\nSave your race, Captain!",
