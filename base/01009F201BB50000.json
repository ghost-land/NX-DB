    "description": "The visual novel \"The Sin\" is an echo of the ancient folklore that permeates the life of the inhabitants of the former USSR. Darkness which came from nothing, and archaic cults associated with the other world of demons and terrors, creeping up into the light in the window with the coming of night.\n\n\"The Sin\" is a vortex of acute social problems mixed with the silent mysticism of endangered villages. This is fear from the past, collected on the basis of real field work of enthusiasts of local lore, who collected folk stories about witches and their connection with the other world. \"The Sin\" is a real folklore mystical without matryoshka dolls and balalaikas, frightening and making you look at your life in a new way.\n\nThe depressing pictures of a dying village and its inhabitants to the dark ambient music of the underground performers make those who are still trying to survive in places where everything has long died, to plunge even deeper into the world of mystical horror and deep despair.",
