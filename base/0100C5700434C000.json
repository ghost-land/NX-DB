    "description": "Sky Rogue is a fwooshy rogue-lite action flight simulator! Blow things up over land, sea, and air, on an infinite number of procedurally-generated islands. Choose one of a diverse set of aeros and kit it out with a dizzying array of weaponry. Go toe-to-toe with enemy aces or assault giant flying aircraft carriers and battleships, but watch out for volleys of missiles; when you die, you're dead.\n\nEXCLUSIVE to the Switch: DANGER ZONE motion controls! Hold the the right Joy-con upright and tilt it to control roll and pitch. Hold the left Joy-con horizontally (L and ZL to the right) and twist it to control throttle.",
