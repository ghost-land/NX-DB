    "description": "Inspector Waffles was hoping his worst days were behind him, but the murder of a high-profile industrialist CEO beloved by the citizens of Cat Town raises new questions and fears.\n\nBeing the best inspector on the CTPD, Waffles has no choice: he's gotta push past the painful memories, don his well-worn overcoat, and prepare to get his paws dirty.\n\nA detective story reminiscent of the old school classics, Inspector Waffles provides plenty of peculiar mystery, a story full of intrigue, and a slew of characters to interrogate, all wrapped into beautifully simple pixel-art. Will you be able to sniff out every clue and nab the murderer?\n\nA REAL TREAT, SEE?\n* A brilliant feline detective in a world full of anthropomorphic cats, dogs, and maybe other species. It’s pixel-animal madness, I tell ya.\n* A beautiful jazzy soundtrack, full of notes and music and harmony pleasing to your ears and brain.\n* Chock full of dry humor and puns about cats and dogs. Seriously, I couldn’t think of any more puns to include. The pun supply is exhausted.",
