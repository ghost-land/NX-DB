    "description": "The unique, one tap (and hold) gameplay makes for a simple yet fun experience. The goal is to get your jumping cube character to the bottom of the level, by breaking through orange gates. Players can try their best to move quickly and earn the rocket powerup, which will boost through the platforms automatically. Players lose when the cube doesn’t jump high enough before trying to break through a gate, or when the character hits a white platform.\n\nMain Features include:\n– Unique gameplay\n– Level & score system\n– Player shop\n– Powerup\n– Sound effects",
