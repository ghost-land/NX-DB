    "description": "Re:Touring is a first-person puzzle game in which you'll explore the abandoned Luoni Energy Competence Center and uncover the facility's history, navigating through a total of 26 varied levels. Using a retro-style computer, you'll create color patterns to control elements such as doors, platforms and lasers. Each mechanism is carefully introduced to make the game accessible to everyone.\n\nThink outside the box\nIn addition to familiar puzzle elements, the centerpiece of the game is the retro computer that generates color patterns. While in the beginning you only create simple patterns to open a door for example, in the later game you automate many elements at the same time to make your way through the levels.\n\nLets go on an adventure\nExplore the abandoned Luoni Energy Competence Center through environmental story telling between each of the puzzles and uncover the history of Luoni Energy and their motivations.\n\nAccessibility\nIn addition to different color palettes for visual impairments and closed captions that describe audio, there is also a hint system that gives clues to the current puzzle or can solve it completely.",
