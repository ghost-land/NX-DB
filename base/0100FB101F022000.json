    "description": "Epyx Rogue\nThe original ever-changing dungeon crawler.\n\nIn the 1980s a computer game emerged that changed the world of fantasy gaming forever. Randomly generated rooms meant that each journey into the infamous Dungeons of Doom was unique. The potent combination of random generation with perma-death proved to be intoxicating, and the game was so influential it spawned an entire genre: \"Rogue-likes\".\n\nNow you too can experience the thrill of dungeon crawling for the fabled Amulet of Yendor in this pioneering game. Delve deep into this recreation of the original graphical port of Rogue by strategy game giants Epyx, that replaced the earlier text-based interface with pixel-art for the first time.\n\n• Battle dozens of unique and powerful enemies.\n• Gather armor, weapons, food and other items to help you on your quest.\n• Scour rooms for secret hidden doors and traps.\n• Discover strange magical spells and potions, which have different wonderous effects every time you play the game.\n• Survive through 26 randomly generated levels, each more tricky and dangerous than the last, to find the Amulet, then escape... if you can!\n\nThis modern version allows you to play this classic game with many modern features, including:\n• Display filters, including an 80s-style CRT filter\n• Play modes - A standard mode that allows for saving games, and an Iron Rogue mode for the original perma-death experience\n• An intuative and comprehensive control scheme - access common tasks with a single button press, and more complex or less-used functions via on-screen control wheels\n• A virtual full instruction manual\n• Choose from several atmospheric soundtracks\n• Dozens of unlockable achievements\n• Global Hall-of-Fame leaderboards",
