    "description": "Farms are set up in islands over calm and clear water.\nIn this tiny fantasy experience, that is easy to do and very relaxing, just like a 3D jigsaw puzzle.\n\nCarefully observe the island, try to memorize it, then shuffle the blocks. Swap blocks to reproduce the desired island and it will compose the archipelago.\n\nThere is no time limit, no logic challenges, nor resources to manage, so you can calmly just focus on the core mechanics while listening to a soothing soundtrack.\n\n- Click on two blocks to swap them;\n- Turn the camera around the island;\n- Focus the camera on a block;\n- Zoom in and out to see details or the big picture;\n- If you need, preview the expected arrangement.\n- 20 different diorama-like islands.\n\nSee your island come to life as you complete certain sectors.\n\nAs you progress building the islands, see your archipelago expand and evolve in the background.\n\nWith clear skies, fresh air, and crystal clear water, among animals and listening to the sounds of nature.",
