    "description": "In the 9th century, Vikings crossed the sea to establish the first settlements in Iceland, documented for the ages in the great book of Landnama. Select a clan and attempt to settle this unwelcoming land, but you’ll need to choose your strategy wisely to survive the ever increasingly harsh toll of winter and complete your saga.\n\nThe thrill of a dungeon crawler with the vibe of a city builder, Landnama is a survival strategy game that forces you to carefully decide your next step. Explore the land and discover hidden challenges and powerful landmarks. Build your settlement and brace for the punishing Winter’s Toll. Settle each region with differently skilled clans while facing ever increasing challenges and no second chances.\n\nOnly one resource exists in the game, Heart, but it must be invested wisely. Heart can be gained in many ways, whether you want to focus on exploring the land as a hunting clan or by building your settlement into a thriving production hub. Establish a completed settlement before winter takes your final heart, but how you get there is up to you.\n\nThis isn't your typical Viking game, there is no combat or raiding. These are farmers, explorers, and builders. But conflict isn’t missing, it comes in the form of a harsh winter that you’ll need every bit of your focus to survive.\n\nLandnama is a taxing race against time with an ever present ticking clock pushing you always closer to winter, but it’s also a beautiful world where you can freeze time and enjoy the atmospheric music and art. Explore in detail the settlement you’ve built and the animated denizens that populate it.",
