You can select a spaceship by moving your screen pointer with the right Joy-Conâ„¢ over it and clicking [ZR].\nOnce a ship is selected you can move it by holding the left Joy-Con.\nShooting is done by holding [ZL] and you can collect weapon upgrades by shooting the green tanks.\nSometimes an enemy ship contains members of your crew. Save them to earn gold.\nWhen a level is cleared you will move on to the next level, they are altogether 100 levels to clear. Watch out for those big bosses with super weapons and infinite health...  Have fun and good luck, commander!",
