    "description": "Heidelberg 1693 is a challenging 2D Action platformer set in a zombie-infested version of 17th century Germany in which the player takes control of one of French King Louis XIVâ€™s famous musketeers. The game adds a layer of tactical combat to the genre by introducing the weapon of choice of musketeers: the musket. Players will be able to fire one powerful - and very effective- musket shot at a time. The weapon must be used wisely because of its long reset time though. Heidelberg 1693 tells its sombre story - featuring real locations and historical figures - across multiple paths and endings.\n\nFeatures:\n- Classic 2D action platformer\n- Story set in a 17th century euchronia \n- Unique musket mechanic adds a layer of strategy to the action\n- Featuring authentic locations and historical figures \n- Beautifully animated sprites\n- Animated cutscenes inspired by silent era films\n- Multiple endings",
