    "description": "You are a highly skilled hacker, and you just discovered your newest venture: a newly-upgraded prison complex with all-digital security. Each cell is protected through a light lock that can be picked remotely through refraction and colour filtering.\n\nPrisnhax is a relaxing yet challenging puzzle game with 50 levels. Learn the intricacies of mirrors, splitters and prisms, which sometimes also act as filters for primary colours to pass through or reflect off of. Direct balls of light into the correctly-coloured finishes to open the cells and break out the prisoners.\n\nPrisnhax features move goals for each prison and global stat tracking, and can be played with a mouse or a gamepad.",
