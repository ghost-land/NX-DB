    "description": "You are the legendary monster hunter on a mission to survive the slaughter through the Dead Kingdom. Armed only with a trusty crossbow and old-fashioned trench coat, you have to reach the bowels of a dying country riddled with hordes of blood-soaking monsters. These scoundrels have to be hunted down!\n\nIn Crossbow Crusade you will have everything needed from instant platforming classics — challenging enemies, hard and rewarding fight system, 90’s-style pixel art and responsive controls. All these features make for a great platforming experience suitable for new gamers and genre veterans alike!",
