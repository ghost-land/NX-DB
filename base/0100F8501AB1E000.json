    "description": "They say this is an ideal town, a true utopia for ghosts…but is it really? Can you really call this place a utopia? More than anything Sayoko longs to return home, but that may prove harder than it seems. With forgotten memories to recover and a mysterious girl to investigate Sayoko has her hands full.\n\nGhostpia is a kinetic, visual novel with colourful visuals that look like a picture book. Adorned with glitches and noise, ghostpia is inspired by a deep sense of longing and nostalgia. Follow Sayoko’s captivating story as she searches for answers in this isolated town, surrounded by a vast desert of snow and unable to fit in with the ghostly atmosphere.\n\nEnjoy a rich cinematic experience with a beautiful melancholic soundtrack and unique sound effects, to fully immerse yourself in the moving, sometimes sombre, sometimes exciting, narrative that ghostpia is trying to tell.",
