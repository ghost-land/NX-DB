Each level will bring a new challenge to the track, more chaos and of course clever moves from your side. All aboard! This train is ready to depart!\n\nThis is a train simulator where patience is a virtue. In order to succeed, you need to wait for the right moment and use your train management skills to drag the trains from one railway to another.\n\nDo you think you have the skills to be a railways master?",
