Confront, console and confess through dialogues with rich and compelling characters. A classic, humane, sci-fi mystery.\n\nSOLVE CHALLENGING PUZZLES\nYou’ll earn a living as Karl Hamba, sole operator of The Bento; monitoring and repairing its core systems alongside Gorky, your on-board artificial intelligence.

Challenge Gorky to a game of chess, nurture a pet tuatara and recycle your own urine into another “delicious” meal. The Bento is brimming with detail and interesting ways to interact with everything you see.",
