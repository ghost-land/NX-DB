    "description": "MAQUETTE is a first-person recursive puzzle game that takes you into a world where every building, plant, and object are simultaneously tiny and staggeringly huge.  MAQUETTE makes it possible by twisting the world into itself recursively in an MC Escher-esque fashion.\n \nHead to the center of the world and you'll feel like a giant, towering over buildings and walls. But venture further out, and start to feel small as things get larger and larger - to the point where cracks in the ground become chasms.\n \nIn Maquette you will explore the scales of everyday problems in a modern-day love story.  Where sometimes the smallest of issues can become insurmountable obstacles.",
