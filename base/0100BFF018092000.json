    "description": "Are you ready for more adventures together? It’s autumn in Lakeside and the Horse Club™ is waiting for you! Ride off with the friends Hannah, Lisa, Sarah and Sofia and let them show you the small town of Hazelwood. The loveliest photos are wanted for a contest there – will you find the best photo motifs together and on your horses? \n\nIt’s not so easy, but luckily you meet up with lots of friends who help you, and afterwards you can play out a wide variety of stories with them: helping out at the riding stables, taking photos of birds, finding hidden treasures – apart from the thrilling main story, diverse experiences await you, too. \n\nDemonstrate your skill at elegant dressage, on the dusty Western riding grounds, in fast-paced obstacle-course races, at herding stubborn livestock, or at “Pop & Gallop” while trying to improve your high score!  \n\nEnjoy rides out in the open, lovingly designed world: Hazelwood, sunny beaches, autumn forests and dusky swamps, all the way to snow-capped mountains. \n\nTend to your horse: feeding, washing, scraping out hooves or simply just an affectionate hug – your friendship and abilities will steadily grow. \n\nDesign yourself and your horse to please you: With over a hundred unlockable pieces of clothing and customizations you can find a style all your own. \n\nIncluding completely dubbed texts  and an original soundtrack by Winifred Phillips.\n",
