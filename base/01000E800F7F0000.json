    "description": "SEN is a minimalistic zen puzzle game about recognising patterns of numbers, colours and shapes.\n\nThe rules of the game are taught with absolutely zero instruction - the progression and design of the levels has been carefully balanced to introduce each rule, thereby giving players the sensation of discovering the rules for themselves.\n\nFeaturing easy to learn rules that are difficult to master, different game modes, and a beautifully relaxing soundtrack.",
