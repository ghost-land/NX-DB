    "description": "Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video game. A game by Remothered s.r.l., directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind Games.\n\nPsychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary’s true intentions, the dread begins.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\nRemothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy.
