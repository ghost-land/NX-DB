Cannon balls fly, stone walls crumble, and your knight takes to the turf, slashing his sword. Once you’ve destroyed your opponent’s base and K.O. the king or queen inside, you win the round. You need three K.O.s to win the match. After each round you can rebuild your castle.\n\nStory:\nPlay through several levels and defeat enemies as you expand your arsenal. This game mode is singleplayer or co-op. You will start your adventure in Braal Kingdom and travel through other kingdoms as you gain cupcakes after each level to unlock new worlds.
