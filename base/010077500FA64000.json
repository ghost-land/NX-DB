    "description": "REALISTIC SIMULATOR \n There are no roads, no paths - only tracks of those who ventured before you. Cars breakdown, fuel is limited and your supplies, scarce. Getting lost is normal and you need to tread your way carefully - yet swiftly. Night limits your vision and sense of direction. Cars get stuck in the mud if you rush without thinking, making you have to use your car’s winch to get out. Crossing rivers and ponds is a gamble you may not win. Rain, snow, fog and blizzard - further increases the difficulty. Should you drive in a straight line through uncertain terrain and risk your car, Or go around and burn more fuel and supplies? It's -ALL- up to you, your skills and guts. \n \nTRUE OFF-ROAD \n No rules, no barriers, no ‘safe-zones’. Only you, your car and the map - against the odds of the wild and uncharted Alaska. The final challenge and ultimate test. Man versus Nature, in all it’s glory and unrelenting force. Are you in for the ride…? =) \n\nFEATURES\n☑ 6 unique cars. \n☑ 2 HUGE, handcrafted and unique maps. \n☑ 8 different tracks. \n☑ 2 game modes - \"Career\" and \"Freeride\". \n☑ Dynamic Weather that affects your car. \n☑ Car Damage System (with visuals). \n☑ Day and Night Cycles. \n☑ Realistic physics. \n☑ Full Control of all the specs of your ride.
