    "description": "Beware! This game is really hard!\nIf you like challenges or you don't mind losing A LOT, this game is for you.\n\nOne simple rule:\nShoot only the squares that have the same color as the background (the bad guys).\n\nOne simple goal:\nSurvive 64.0 seconds.\n\nShoot first, listen later:\nReflexes and memory are key to this game. \nWe use rhythm as hints in certain parts, but you should trust more in your eyes.\n\nA more formal description:\n64.0 is a minimal fast-paced arcade game, where you shoot the squares that have the same color as the background, but since the background is constantly changing, everyone can be a bad guy!\n\nFeatures:\nFast-paced action.\nAwesome chiptune soundtrack.\nOne unique mechanic each level.\nEndless mode.",
