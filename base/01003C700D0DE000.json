The story is both bizarre and exciting making players get lost in a mushroom field, search for a secret passage, and run experiments in a laboratory.

The story moves along while meeting various characters, gathering information, solving puzzles, and clearing minigames. There are elements that test skills including memory and observation, and the many items that appear add to its appeal to the game.\n\nThe picture book-like graphics and story about animals who live like humans will draw you in to the world of Rain City.",
