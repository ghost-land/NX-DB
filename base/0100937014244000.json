    "description": "What The Dub is a multiplayer party game where each player overdubs missing dialogue from hilariously awful B-movies, woefully outdated PSAs, and bizarre industrial films, with their own witty (or just plain stupid) dubs. \n\nPlayers watch the dubs and vote on the best one. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins! It's just that easy!\n\nWhat The Dub takes “bad movie night” and expands it into an interactive, fast-paced, multiplayer game that friends and family, both local and afar, can enjoy!\n\nOver 500 so-bad-they're-good clips to dub!\n\nYou write the dub, we do the talking (dubs are played back via text-to-speech).\n\nPlay head to head with 1 to 6 players. Enter text and vote using your phone, tablet, or computer.\n\nUp to 6 players can enter dubs, while an additional 12 audience members can vote.\n\nSupports local multiplayer. Use streams/screen sharing to connect with remote players. ",
