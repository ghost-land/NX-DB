They are used in sports, at war... and for you, they are moneymakers.\nBecome Mech Mechanic and open your own workshop to dismantle, fix and rebuild gigantic robots. \nEvery mech has its own special purpose and as a Mech Mechanic not only will you be able to diagnose, repair or change the parts but also paint, update and accommodate mechs for their new function. \nEven if you’re the best Mech Mechanic in the world, you’ll find the parts that are unfixable. Do what you can with what you’ve got, but if you find some junk among your parts… dismount it and order new ones. If you don’t like wasting things, don’t worry!
