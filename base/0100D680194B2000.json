    "description": "Revisit the first two Pikmin games on the Nintendo Switch™ system!\n\nReintroduce yourself to the plantlike Pikmin and strategic gameplay that this charming series is rooted in. From finding a way home to collecting treasure, Olimar (plus Louie in the Pikmin 2 game) must partner with a parade of Pikmin to survive the harshest of conditions. Both games support optional motion controls for more options when guiding your floral friends. \n\nFind your way home in the original Pikmin-plucking adventure\n\nMeet Captain Olimar and a capable cast of red, blue, and yellow Pikmin on a dire mission across a larger-than-life planet. Olimar must guide his loveably-leafy companions through obstacles, in battle, and when collecting his missing ship parts.\n\nMeet even more Pikmin (and Louie) on a treasure-hunting expedition\n\nSwap between Olimar and Louie to divide and conquer in Pikmin 2. Tasked with helping pay off their employer’s debt, the pint-sized pair teams up with Pikmin (including purple and white Pikmin) to collect treasure on...you guessed it...a strange planet. Time ticks away on the surface, but cave systems let you take your time to let your strategy blossom. ",
