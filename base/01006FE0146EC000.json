In an attempt to break off the ceremony he gets into a flow of energy released by the artifact and instantly turns into a demon!\n\nWanderer is now eager to regain his former appearance but to do so he needs the artifact which was stolen afterwards. The hero sets on a path to find it, fighting the hordes of demons along the way.\n\nOther features:\n\nSophisticated combat system. \nImprove your skills by mastering various stances for lightning-fast parrying and inflicting maximum damage with spectacular finishing moves!
