    "description": "Claws of Furry creates a blend of today's fast paced action with classic arcade Beat'em up badassery. With four distinct environments with unique enemies, the challenge is always evolving. Multiple modes such as Rogue-like and Arena, and unlockable outfits with unique bonuses, will keep you coming back for more. Fear not the rogue-like though; with the Pussycat mode you can play the game with checkpoints in every level, in a classic linear adventure. This will not make it much easier though, fast reflexes and a keen eye are required in order to survive the journey to free your Master. You don't have to take this journey alone though; you can have a group of up to four people in local co-op!\n\nClaws of Furry can be played using one or two joy-con controllers for single and multiplayer!\nConnect more controllers to support up to 4 players!",
