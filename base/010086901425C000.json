    "description": "The Colonists is a relaxing city building game. Each bot has a job to fulfil, from harvesting crops and fishing at the lake, to transporting resources and discovering distant lands. \n\nYou'll advance through three different Ages as you build infrastructure for your colony by constructing road, boat and train transport systems. Help them work together to achieve automated harmony. \n\nTake on a series of individual campaign missions, play randomly generated maps, compete on player-designed creations or build your colony unfettered by any constraints in the sandbox mode.\n\nExplore, research, manage, tweak and refine to your heart's content.",
