And even though you know your stuff, you'll have to deal with security, alarms and sealed, secret compartments.\nIf any of those things will stress you out, you can always go on a shopping spree, chill out at a pub or let off some steam at a gentlemen's club.\nExcited yet? \nThen grab your gloves and crowbar and get ready for a tricky, robbery adventure!",
