    "description": "In Gravity Rider Zero, you will be climbing over obstacles, discovering trials to overcome in each level. Giant ramps, lasers, spikes, or good old gravity will try to get in your way.\n\nEnjoy a classic solo career progression system: after 3 trails you move onto the next stage. Each of them introduces a new gimmick and every planet has a unique environment!\n\nCollect dozens of unique racing vehicles with futuristic designs. Unlock new bikes by completing tasks, beating challenges or breaking track records: there’s always a new reward to look forward to! From trials bikes to ATVs, WW2 era motorbikes to space rockets, they're all in there. You can customize your vehicle collection too. Give your motorbike a new paint job or upgrade your kart with a neon lights trail - upgrade your style!\n\nThe controls in Gravity Rider Zero are simple and precise. Accelerate and tilt your bike in the right places to pass over obstacles faster. Brake in time to avoid traps. Always tilt after a jump to touch the ground earlier and gain more traction. Brake before a jump to minimize your air time, try and try again. Or, just focus on making sure you pass obstacles, don't crash and beat the level.\n",
