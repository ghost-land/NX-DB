    "description": ".. my parents and I moved into our new home a few weeks ago. Now I can finally celebrate my first Halloween here. I'm so excited! Mommy has already got me a new witch costume. Hahahaha\n\nMum says I should take care. As a true witch, many things could happen. Mommy told me about her first Halloween and how she was followed by ghosts. But I do not believe itâ€¦.\n\nI hope I get many great things with which I can decorate the garden.\n\nI am Poppy - and this is my first Halloween.",
