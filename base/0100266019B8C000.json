    "description": "You don't know a single word in the language of this world.\nDeduce the meanings of words the person before you uses to communicate with you.\nThen try to understand them like a puzzle, one piece at a time.\nYou are free to perceive the meaning of the words you read.\n\nThe relationship between the two characters is built on the words you interpret.\nAnd their story is also built on the words you interpret.\n\nTheir world changes according to your understanding.\nMaybe their story is a short, ordinary story, or maybe it's a long, peculiar story.\nOr both stories could exist at the same time. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nThe story is only complete with your interpretation.\nSo certainly, every story your interpretation results in is correct.\nEven if you don't understand the story at first, you have the opportunity to repeat it over and over again.\n\nThis is a short and long story, of only seven days.",
