It is a monster title that reigned at the top of the popularity rankings in PC game magazines for a long time, with its diverse and beautifully composed fields, including plains, castles, churches, and labyrinths.\n\nIn addition, the newly released MSX version features a password save system and screen-switching scroll function, which are slightly different from the previously released PC-8801 version.\n\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.\n",
