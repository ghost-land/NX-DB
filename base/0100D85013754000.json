Ok, let's explain...\n\nA colourful hell. \nElliot is a colourful 2D platformer inspired in 16-bit classics yet with a hardcore touch. Don't be fooled by appearances, it's a tough game! Run, jump and dash through over 60+ levels to solve the mystery surrounding the World of Elliot, Manuel and the adorable Mombas.\n\nNeed to know more?\nElliot, that loveable little blue ball, is a Momba, a wild, free, musical creature who lives alone in the natural world. Well, not entirely alone: with his friend, Manuel. But one apparently ordinary day, strange things begin to happen.\n\nHow to play?\nIt's easy: run, jump and dash in any direction. Die, come straight back and die again.\n\nWhat will you find?\n- Two loveable characters, Elliot and Manuel.\n- Collectibles to help you discover the story of Elliot's World.\n- You yourself, making titanic efforts to get through the 60-plus levels in 11 chapters.\n- Stress, frustration and possibly rage. but don't worry, the soundtrack will make everything much easier.\n- Speedrun mode, if you want to break personal records or challenge your friends.\n- Achievements, in case the ordinary game itself leaves you in need of more.\n\nLove letter to platformers:\nElliot is our lil' love letter to the genre. If you dig platforms and challenges, we promise you're gonna love this experience.\n",
