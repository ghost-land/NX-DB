    "description": "The rules are simple: tap an arrow to move it in the direction it faces. Make a row of 3 tiles of the same color and the tiles disappear. \n\nIf that sounds too easy, don't worry - you'll find yourself in situations that require clever manipulation of the game board. There's an assortment of objectives to keep you on your toes: tiles that chase you, tiles that must be matched within a few moves, tiles that must be protected, and lots more.\n\nAs well as 38 freeform stages which play out differently every time, we have created 75 challenges with unique solutions and an endless mode, so the game is crammed with content to keep you busy!\n\nAre you ready to Swapperoo?",
