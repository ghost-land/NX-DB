    "description": "Your goal is to transport Billy's pyrotechnic to the exit using dynamites and springs. You can place them on the map wherever you want, then watch your TNT explode and send Billy into space! Billy Billy is not going to move anywhere, but the explosive dynamite should be the right motivation for him. The game contains 25 different stages, each of which can be completed in many ways. Will you only use TNT, or maybe you'll build a complicated spring sequence? Just be creative and help Billy Bomber, a TNT specialist at his work!",
