    "description": "\"Cobalt Core is a sci-fi roguelike deckbuilder with a unique single-axis combat system that will throw you for a loop. Many loops!\n\nGive orders to your crew by playing cards: Will you raise shields to protect your ship, dodge incoming missiles and cannon fire to avoid damage outright, or strike preemptively to disable your enemy’s weapons? Outmaneuver your foes to stay just ahead of impending calamity, and reach the Cobalt Core!\n\nFEATURES:\n\nFRESH NEW SPIN ON TACTICS – dodge attacks and target weak points in this unique single-axis take on tactics combat. Outwit the enemy in a high-stakes game of cat and mouse!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR DECK – hundreds of cards and split upgrade paths mean no two runs will be the same. Find that perfect combo that brings your deck from powerful to overpowered.\n\nGET TO KNOW YOUR CREW – each character comes with a completely unique playstyle and their own personal story. Bring 3 along, mix and match their decks, and see how these little goobers get along with each other.\n\nTONS OF REPLAYABILITY – hundreds of different character+ship combinations before you even hit “start run”. \n\nFORWARD MOMENTUM – untangle a narrative and unlock more playstyles as you go. Is there any escape from this time loop?\n\nBy the makers of Sunshine Heavy Industries, recipient of IGF's Honorable Mention for Excellence in Design 2022.\"",
