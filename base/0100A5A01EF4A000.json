    "description": "Dare To Spread; It is a turn-based strategy game in which we shape the course of the war by making important choices. In this strategy game you control rebel armies. We occupy enemy countries with our armies. We do illegal work to finance the army.\n\nAs in every war, there is a commander who leads the armies in this alternative history game. Our command must survive so we can continue the battle. In this way, it can enable us to prevail by putting the war strategy in the middle. We can help him survive by using food and water.\n\nIn order to form an army, we need to control at least 1 state. We also need to have financial strength. In order to earn money in the game, days need to pass. In this way, we will earn very little money. In war, we can earn more money by doing illegal activities such as kidnapping people, demanding ransom, and make banners to earn money faster.\n\nIn this strategy game, we will try to make 6 capitalist countries communist by war, that is, by force. Right economy, together with the administration we will control communist rebel armies. We will try to destroy the enemy armies by purchasing poison gas, aircraft, artillery and paratrooper units. When we defeat 1 enemy country, we will try to defeat the next enemy country and make it communist.\n\nWe may have captured 1 province in the war. The important thing is that the province we occupy does not revolt against us. For this, we can increase the loyalty rate of the province we occupy by making propaganda. For this, it is important to explain the communist ideology and give the infrastructure and health system to the people.\n\nWe earn 1 diplomacy point per turn. With the 1 diplomacy point we earn, we increase our relations with other communist countries. In this way, we can get money and military aid.",
