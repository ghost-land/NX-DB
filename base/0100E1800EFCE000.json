Now, under the watchful eye of its original creators, it's finally in English!\n\nHave you ever felt it odd that the heroes of RPGs go around opening villagers' closets and stealing from them? Or that they travel the world indiscriminately killing all monsters they meet? This game looks at the RPGs we all know and love from a new perspective.\n\nStory\nOne moon-lit night, a young boy is sucked into the depths of his television set.\nHe falls into a place called 'Moon World', and thus begins a search for love in order to recover the lost moonlight.\n\nHere, the mighty hero of Moon World murders innocent animals for experience, \nbut the boy's growth comes from saving the souls of the animals and gathering the love in the world.\n\nYes, in this game, you level up by loving, not fighting.\n\nThe inhabitants of this world are all unique. Observe their daily lives and learn where they hide their secret love.\n\n\"Now, please, open the door!\"\n\n\nAn RPG without combat!\nGather love to level up!\nCharacters with their own lives and routines!\nSave the spirits of the murdered monsters: soul catch!\nChoose your own music with the Moon Disc system!",
