    "description": "Whisper Trip is a fast cooperative action side-scroller with a touch of cyberpunk. You’re a newly recruited TPF agent. Who just learned that TPF stands for Tactical Police Force – an anti-terrorist squad with an obvious mission to eliminate criminal groups…\n\nKatanas… Who does not like those curved blades? Especially the thermal katanas ready to slash anyone or anything in a split second? But beware of your enemies; they aren’t stupid and they are unique in their own pecular way. You will learn to treat them as equals; and invent a special approach to each.\n\nCut them as regular chickens, evade their lunges, repel their bullets, adapt yourself, and listen carefully….\n\nYou will soon find out the benefits of cooperation with your partner. Do not hesitate to ask your trusted fellow agent to help you out of this mess.\n\nThis story is rich with unexpected twists and turns, where each move leads to profound consequences… Think before you act!",
