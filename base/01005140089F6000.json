And if you're like me, you'll get really, really into it.\" - Kirk Hamilton, Kotaku.\n \nCount as fast as you can in this mind splitting game that forces you to locate numbers as fast as possible, and flip your perspective backwards and forwards at an almost impossible rate!\n \nThe new universe is about to begin.

All that remains is for the DNA architect to successfully sequence the DNA that will become the origin of everything that exists...\nNuclien takes a simple concept and turns it into an addictive and challenging experience. Race against the clock to find the numbers in their correct order by counting up, down or even doing both at the same time!\n \nFeatures: \n· 77 stages of hyper-challenging reaction based action!\n· 6 modes of play.\n· Music and visuals merge to create an interactive musical landscape that lets players get lost in the experience.",
