    "description": "Speed Limit is a non-stop genre-warping arcade experience that never slows down. No cuts, no lapses in the chaos, Speed Limit is an old-school action extravaganza boiled down to its core elements: Hard. Fast. Addictive.\n\nAs soon as you think you've learned how the game works, it changes to a completely different genre, taking you through the history of the golden arcade era.\n\nFight through a nail-biting side-scrolling shooter, race to the finish in an explosive top-down car chase, take flight in a thrilling fake-3D dogfight, and expect the unexpected. Speed Limit seamlessly changes styles, transforms the gameplay, and offers new challenges the moment you feel comfortable.\n\nA Genre-changing Rollercoaster\nRunning. Driving. Flying. Dying (many, many times!) - From the moment you click play to the moment you die, you are in control.\n\nAnd you will die. A lot.",
