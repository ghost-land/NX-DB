Tap, hold and slide to perform and achieve perfect combos and harmony!\n\nThere are multiple ways to tackle each track -  along with four difficulty settings you can choose to ‘Tune’ or ‘Purify’ songs.

The world has lost sound and color, and the task falls to our two heroes – Fisica and Ritmo – to revive ‘Notalium’ and bring music back to the world.
