    "description": "Now, there’s another far far galaxy from a parallel universe — and suddenly the Rainbow planet appeared there for no particular reason. It had such a strong magnetic field that it practically smashed the protective barrier of the prison planet Abakaz. Many dangerous galactic criminals have managed to escape and settled in some uninhabited lands. All these unfortunate events bring us to the point where the adventures of a young hunter from planet Earth will start. It’s you, of course!\n\nSo, what do we have in our digital pockets:\n\n- Five unique planets\n- Unicorn’s head acting all bossy (gonna neigh you to death)\n- Energy swords\n- Funny space armor that looks so familiar\n- Procedurally generated levels\n- And much more (we just have a limit of six key features)\n\nSo there you go, going to have a great time with our newest game: Space Roguelike Adventure! And yeah, we’ve picked this title because it’s a perfect summary of this literary-rich marketing post.",
