That will no doubt put the highest price on his head again and he will once again outdo Badass at last!\n\nHalfway through the journey the stagecoach in which Lone is traveling is attacked by Badass' hitmen and Lone must walk to Oldewell to make history again.\n\n - Meet a host of quirky characters\n - Solve intricate and fun puzzles\n - Rob the safest safe in the county\n - Escape from jail\n - Mix dangerous ingredients\n - Blow things up\n - Tell lies\n - Make jokes\n - Squeeze cactus\n - ...\n - Oh, and...
