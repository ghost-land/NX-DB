Use your growing collection to influence the story and unravel Undermereâ€™s dark mysteries.\n\nExplore the lands beyond your store to find new plants, but be careful! The dark woods and lakes are not always friendly to a simple herbalist. You might discover powers beyond your wildest dreams - or lose your mind completely. Use context clues to determine which places to visit, and which to avoid!\n\nUsing your trusty encyclopedia and clues found on your explorations, you'll learn more about the strange plants you come across. By identifying each plant, you will be able to use their effects to influence the story -- from hypnotic hallucinogens to powerful poisons.",
