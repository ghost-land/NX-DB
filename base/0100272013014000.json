You must brave dark caverns, ancient structures, and other mysterious locations in order to save Head.\nAlong the way you will find new abilities, unlocking new areas and puzzles, and if you go even farther afield, who knows what you will find in the hidden corners of the world.\n\nPUZZLES\nAs you explore, you will come across numerous puzzles that use the environment, strange creatures, and old technology to challenge your logic and creativity.\nThe world is complex, nothing is as it seems, and you must master Airhead’s many abilities if you want to stand a chance of saving Head. \n\nCOMPANIONSHIP\nBody and Head must work together to accomplish their goal, and as time passes their bond and abilities will grow.

Incomplete, the head-like organism is left to die, as it slowly leaks air.\nAn unassuming Body, with an instinct to help others, witnesses the tragedy. With no thoughts to the consequences, it takes its new head’s fate on its shoulders, becoming Airhead.\n\nNow, Airhead must rely on air tanks to keep the Head inflated, while it searches far and wide for the machine that stole Head’s air source.
