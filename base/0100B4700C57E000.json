    "description": "In Bow to Blood you will compete to become Champion of the Arena, as its inscrutable Overseers test you and your fellow challengers in a winner-takes-all fantasy reality show.\n\nTAKE COMMAND\nStand at the bridge of your mighty airship, with immersive high-tech controls that respond to your touch as you pilot the ship, task your crew, aim weapons, route power – and even pull your trusty sidearm when things get up close and personal.\n\nFORGE ALLIANCES AND PLOT BETRAYALS\nAt the end of each match you’ll need enough friends to avoid getting voted off the season!  Your AI rivals in Bow to Blood have their own motivations, objectives, and personalities. Assist your fellow challengers and gain their support, or exploit them for personal gain and earn their enmity. The choice is yours, but choose wisely – challengers will remember how you have treated them, and in the Arena, grudges die hard.\n\nEVERY PLAYTHROUGH IS UNIQUE\nRandomized encounters and a rotating cast ensure no two experiences will be the same. Play over and over again to discover new environments, opponents, and challenges.",
