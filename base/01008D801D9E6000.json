    "description": "“Trash Punk” is where anarchy reigns, and you’re the opossum punk rocking the apocalypse! This isn’t just a shooter; it's a top-down, adrenaline-pumping riot set in a world gone delightfully mad.\n\nArmed with everything from gnarly firearms to wicked melee weapons, get ready to bash and blast through hordes of mutated oddities. Melee isn't just for show – smash your way to ammo as you carve a path through chaos. At every twisted turn, make tough calls: grab a new weapon, an upgrade, or some much-needed healing.\n\nThe game’s world is a wild mashup of punk rock rebellion and post-apocalyptic mayhem, where every rampage is a unique blend of chaos, with procedurally generated levels ensuring no two runs are alike. With a soundtrack dominated by heavy riffs, each level is a mosh pit of danger and excitement.\n\nGrab your weapons and start the rebellion. How far can you go?",
