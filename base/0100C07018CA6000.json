After a fierce battle, the people managed to seal off the evil god, but what was left behind was only a desolate land. The people thus chose to abandon the land and live in the sky.\n\nSuch fairy tales were passed down as legends. At this time, people had wings called Wings of the Heart and lived a peaceful life. It was an era of long-lasting tranquility. ...But the collapse had quietly begun.\n\nWhen a young man calls your name, the name of the spirit, the story begins to unfold. A story set on a floating continent in the sky, where thoughts and prayers intersect.\n\nSupported Text Languages:\n• Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings and the Lost Ocean: English, French, Italian, German, Spanish\n• Baten Kaitos Origins: English",
