A strategy is key, but luck also plays a role!\nCreate your elite formation from a roster of 45+ heroes and be the best player in 8 player online matches.\n\n[Fast Matches]\nMatches that last 10-20 minutes are fully packed with multiple strategic decisions and tactical adaptations to the situation on the battlefield.\n\n[No to Pay-to-Win]\nMoney CANNOT BUY victory. Only strategy matters. Enjoy the fun of the classic auto battler mode. Players can buy cosmetics through an in-game currency that they receive after every battle or buy them as DLC.

Strengthen your team by combining 3 of the same heroes to level up, triggering Affinity Bonuses and equipping them with items.\n",
