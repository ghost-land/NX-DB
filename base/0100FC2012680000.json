    "description": "A sudden catastrophe has led life on Earth to the verge of extinction.\nThe Professor, the only survivor, spent years performing research in an underground laboratory trying to recreate life.\nThe energy he needs to do this can only be harvested outdoors, where he himself cannot go. He therefore created an android to help him.\nPlants are the only living things left in this world where human civilization is no more. It is cruel, but beautiful.\nThe Professor and the android embark on a quest to bring animals back to the planet.\n\nThis is a tale of creating life on a dead planet.\n\nWorld for Two is coming to Nintendo Switch™!\nThe animations for all creatures have been redrawn, to help them come alive even better.\n\nOnce you complete the main story, you will be able to enjoy “Chapter 0”, a new special story that includes new art and music and will tell you more about the Professors’s past.\nAnd as an added bonus, once you complete the game, you will unlock the option to change the main story’s soundtrack to a fascinating new version played by a piano quintet (piano, two violins, viola and violoncello)",
