    "description": "Try as fast as possible to clean up the playfield, earn bonus time with speed combinations and discover all special items.\n\nOn the left you can see the prehistoric man. He must throw a puck of the same color as the stone to be cleared to remove it from the playing field. To do this, the player presses the assigned correct button on the controller. The faster you play and the fewer mistakes you make, the more points you can get. There are also special shots to clear the field more quickly.",
