As the regular means of analysis proved too limited to properly investigate the nature of these extra-natural phenomena, they devised a new means of examination. Using a device of their design, they are able to induce telepathically-gifted patients into a dream state, and connect their minds to a cursed or malignant object, allowing them to investigate their history and put a stop to the evil they embody. You are one of those patients.\n\nIn the first installment of the game, you will play through the case of Henrietta Kedward. You’ll be able to connect with this malicious old woman through a malignant toy with a dark past and soon you’ll find yourself in a nightmare set during her lifetime, surrounded by terror and mystery.\n\nWhen inside the nightmare, you’ll never know what’s going to happen next, even on multiple playthroughs as the game constantly shifts, taking advantage of its procedurally generated elements.",
