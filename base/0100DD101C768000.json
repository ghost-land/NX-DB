    "description": "The time is here again to stretch your naughty fingers! Do you know why Lord of the Click appears for the fourth time before your discerning gaze? It's simple - players love Lord of the Click, because this series of games is more than the SPACE itself! How sparklingly I made a path to the main description, huh!?\n\n\nLord of the Click: Interstellar Wars takes the endless conflict of good, evil and arthritis to a whole new  cosmic level! Fight aliens and mutants, colonize new planets, reach for the stars, and all this under the measured and lulling creak of your joints. You haven't had so much fun yet and definitely won't until we release the fifth Lord of the Click game! (By the way, the games are not story related, you can start right with this one!)",
