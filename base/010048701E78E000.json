Explore the depths of the ocean, but be sure to watch your air levels! Friendly creatures like Bean, the jellyfish weapons dealer, help you along your journey for the…not-so-friendly creatures. \n\nAbout the Development Team\nWhat They Don't Sea was created by Team Atlantis, a group of  middle school girls, at the 3-week Girls Make Games summer camp in Durham, NC.
