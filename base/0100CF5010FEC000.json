Alongside her was Cheshire, her very first demon, possessing Cereza’s stuffed toy. Play as both Cereza and Cheshire and search through the treacherous forest to look for the power to save Cereza’s mother.\n\nControl both Cheshire and Cereza to solve puzzles and fend off fiends\n\nAny good story has a lesson about teamwork, no? In this tale, Cereza and Cheshire coordinate their efforts to fight faeries and solve puzzles. Use the Left Joy-Con™ controller to move Cereza and bind enemies with her magic. With the Right Joy-Con controller, move Cheshire to slash and chomp foes.\n\nTurn the pages of Cereza’s story as you explore the enchanting, storybook-inspired Avalon Forest\n\nAvalon Forest is just as beautiful as it is beastly. Each new area looks like it has been painted carefully by hand. Fully narrated story scenes are told through the vibrantly illustrated pages of a storybook. Be sure to stop and smell the roses in this whimsical world, but don’t tarry too long—the forest has a taste for lost witches.",
