So are the consequences.\n\nFeatures: \n- The torture chamber: study your victims, find their weak spot, and use your extensive arsenal (or their loved ones) to break them\n- An occult underground: a town filled with mysticism built around Medieval artefacts, such as the Hand of Glory and Mandrake Root\n- A dark economy: a market in dead flesh with you as its main supplier\n- Synesthesia: your character's unique perceptive abilities make him a walking lie detector\n- Staying sane: as a professional torturer you'll need to constantly manage your sanity to survive",
