    "description": "Driven by the rare illness plaguing his family, Joshua has to face the innermost depths of his past - moments both beautiful and painful. Exploring parallel realities through deja vu seems to be the only way he can recover his memories and salvage his life.\n\nThe Gap tells the difficult story of one man’s struggle to find a cure for his family’s sickness by diving ever deeper into his own psyche and through the exploration of the memories dear to his heart.\n\nJoshua Hayes is a neuroscientist, whose family is touched by a rare genetic disorder that slowly eats away at one’s memories, dissolving the person’s sanity and personality. The struggle and fight of the family is witnessed through the lense of memories of their highest and lowest moments.\n\nBeing part of an experimental program to cure the disease, led by a biotech giant - Neuraxis, Joshua finds himself entangled in a corporate intrigue. While exploring the raw, minimalist spaces, he comes across items that act as gateways to his past. \n\nIn hopes of untangling the web of memories, he’ll need to face a distressing question - can he really trust himself?\n\nIf you had lost it all - family, memories, life. Could you trust yourself?",
