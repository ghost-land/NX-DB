In a moment our Canny is ready for the adventure to find some answers.\n\nWhat happened to the City? Why did all robots stop moving? Did anyone survive except him? Who knows… But you’ll be able to learn the truth and try to fix it all with Scrap Garden finally available on consoles! Like someone said before: Scrap Garden may look a little dented, but its heart is definitely in the right place. And that’s what really matters.",
