You start off as a captain of a small cloudship and work your way towards establishing your own trade company.\n\nMerchant of the Skies is an experimental game: it does not have a distinct genre, but tries to capture the feeling of travelling the world and establishing your own company.

Find the best trade routes and profit from them\n* Discover the world!
