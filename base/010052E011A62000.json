    "description": "CHAOS REIGNS AND BULLETS FLY\nBright, frantic and frenetic combat will keep you on your toes. Meet new threats on every floor and new challenges in every room. The mighty wizbot Mephisto is waiting at the top... do you have what it takes to topple them?\n \nUTILIZE AN IMMENSE ARSENAL\nMagic + Guns = Magic Guns. Don’t rely on bullets alone, because magic just makes everything better. Arm yourself with guns that shoot lightning, snowballs, sawblades, giant fists, and more!\n \nBRING YOUR FRIENDS\nOne mage with a gun is good. Two is better. Three is a party. And four is a robot wrecking crew. There’s safety in numbers. So grab your best buddies and some more controllers to retake the tower from marauding hordes of magic-infused robots!\n \nEACH ATTEMPT IS UNIQUE\nThe tower is endlessly changing. Each time you try to retake it the rooms have shifted, the enemies swapped, the danger different. Failure means you have to start all over again. Though you may not make it to the top it doesn’t mean you won’t have hours of fun trying!\n \nLEVEL UP TOGETHER\nThe party that levels together plays together, so no one ever feels underpowered or unable to contribute. Everyone votes on the next upgrade or ability. No one gets left behind in the race to the top. If one falls, they can be revived!\n \nFIGHT THROUGH THE HORDES\nMake your way back up the tower to take your place as the rightful ruler and show those robots who’s boss. You made them, you can break them. Get your guns and get shooting, there’s no time to reload when you’ve got to save the spire!\n\nThis game requires two control sticks to play. Each player needs a pair of Joy-Con™ controllers or a Pro Controller.",
