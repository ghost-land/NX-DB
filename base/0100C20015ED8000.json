    "description": "Atmospheric isometric puzzler. Collect green crystals to open the portal that brings you to the next level. Find the right path and donâ€™t fall into the abyss.\n\nThe game has 30 levels. Later levels will be more challenging and more different tiles will be introduced. The player moves on a grid of tiles. Some of these tiles will be disappearing when you are stepping off it and others will teleport you to another place. One tile acts as a cage with another that will free you from entrapment. There is even a tile that creates more tiles! ",
