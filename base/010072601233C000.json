    "description": "THE STORY\n \nOh wow, I'm actually kinda surprised you scrolled down this far...that's awesome! My name's Chris, and I'm so excited to tell you about my game! It’s a ‘90s-inspired adventure platformer about the totally normal adventures I went on as a chubby kid back in 1995 - traveling the world, learning useful abilities, and, naturally, getting kidnapped and turned into a balloon by cartoon villains. Thankfully, I escaped and learned to use my transformation as a kind of superpower. I got to learn all kinds of cool stuff - how to throw fireballs and lightning, how to bounce around like a basketball and rocket around the earth. It's a neat story...I think. I really hope you'll enjoy it - I had a lot of fun making it!\n\nFEATURES\n \n • Uncover a sinister story in a quirky, cartoon-like universe.\n • Explore 9 locations around the world in any order you please, plus the Kingdom of Lost Balloons and more!\n • Build Chris from a weak kid into the ultimate hero by upgrading him with unique special moves and abilities that you can customize to your style.\n • Learn (or purchase) increasingly powerful spells and techniques.\n • Battle bizarre villains across the globe, including samurai cats, cyborg penguins and whiny vampires.\n • Float or fall through unique platforming challenges.\n • Two additional full game modes, including bonus content - a more difficult and humorous Mean Mode, and Developer Commentary.\n • A variety of unlockable content and secrets to discover, including an in-depth backstory.\n • Numerous difficulty settings, including \"Ridiculously Easy\" for players who prefer to never die, and \"Hard for No Reason\" for crazy people.\n • Snort out loud with a game chock-full of laughs.",
