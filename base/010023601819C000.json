Fight your way through puzzles and obstacles to uncover the story that surrounds this broken, run down society, where only children are still free. But for how long?A pure hand-drawn pixel art adventure that will keep you on your toes from the very beginning, with a few jump scares and a thrilling atmosphere but still suitable for all ages as it does not feature any gore or violence.\nFull Void is a spiritual successor to classic cinematic puzzle platformers of the 80s and 90s, with a modern twist, innovative visual and gameplay mechanics. Along with traditional puzzles, you can use your hacking skills to interact with elements of the game and make your way through this hostile world full of creatures continuously on the verge to get you. In a 2D world, aspects of 3D have been integrated both in the gameplay and visuals.\nThe game features hand-drawn pixel art graphics and custom animations that are integral part of the gameplay, along with dynamic lighting, minimalistic sound design and immersive cutscenes for an atmosphere that will keep you on your toes from the very beginning.\nFull Void tells a story of oppression and isolation through the environment and gameplay with the support of compelling ambient sounds and old-school Amiga MOD music.
