    "description": "The royal road of pencil puzzles, this puzzle is extremely fun. In \"Kakuro\", you break down the totaled numbers given as hints to fill in the spaces. Well. We say \"break down the numbers\", but in Nikoli's Kakuro very little calculations are actually required, with concentration and the power of deduction being the most necessary attributes.\n\nThe options menu, manual, and other text are available in Japanese, English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish.",
