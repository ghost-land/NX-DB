    "description": "In 911 Operator, you take on the role of an emergency dispatcher, who has to rapidly deal with the incoming reports. Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity. Keep in mind, that the person on the other side of the line might turn out to be a dying daughter’s father, an unpredictable terrorist, or just a prankster. Can you handle all of this?\n\nPlay through all available cities, events, calls, and reports! Unlock all equipment and vehicles! The complete 911 Operator collection in one neat package!\n\n911 Operator Deluxe Edition includes:\n\n- Base game\n- Every Life Matters DLC\n- Special Resources DLC\n- Search & Rescue DLC\n- First Response DLC",
