    "description": "In space, no one can hear you scream - neither a victorious cry, nor one loaded with frustration. So what shall it be, Space Pioneer, when you are the Captain of it all?\n\nBUILD A WONDROUS VIEW\nBuild, install and redesign your station to perfection in a full 3D view taking advantage of the spectacular visuals provided by Unreal Engine 4. Look at your creation in a 360 degrees view, zooming in and out to marvel at its beauty.\n\nLook at the magnificent in-game star constellations, nebulas and planets the development team spent weeks researching to realistically provide in-game visualisations within the endless game sky.\n\nFOCUS ON THE ABSTRACT\nMonitor and set up production cycles, resources and their distribution. Focus either on efficiency or yield, treating everything as a diligent spreadsheet master - but with an abstract layout system resembling a circuit board to help you design the best connections, nooks and crannies to make your station a resounding engineering success!\n\nECONOMICS, ERRORS AND MORE!\nA unique economic system provides you with a key objective - make your station efficient and profitable or fail!\n\nThe normal route of business can be, however, disrupted by a number of disruptions: from hacker attacks to error and malfunctions each module and its system entail in your management of the station.\n\nYour production may also simply overload, given the production strain - so plan, execute and design to perfection!\n\nEXPLORE UNKNOWN PLANETS\nThere are 3 distinct campaign missions where you need to terraform a given planet, make it habitable and easy to extract resources from.\n\nBuilt with a background narrative, each of these missions enable you to focus on the two game modes in order to build your station in such a way as to successfully fulfill their objectives. \n\nAre you going to be the most efficient, the most industrious or have the most graphically appealing modules set-up? Anything goes as long as the mission is successful!\n\nENDLESS DREAMS\nYou can also kick back and focus on building the greatest and either best looking or most efficient station there ever was - within either our Creative or Endless modes built especially for this purpose.\n\norbit.industries blends inspiration from classic science fiction literature, movies, and popular space-opera TV series with actual knowledge and progress achieved in the field of space exploration, space engineering, and orbital stations development.",
