    "description": "OVERVIEW\nGlitchhikers: The Spaces Between is about the thoughts that exist between destinations, the parts of journeys that dominate our time but not our attention, when our minds wander to parts of ourselves, and our world normally left unexamined. On a late-night highway drive, a quiet train car in the early hours, a walk through a moonlit park, or the endless wait in a deserted airport, we listen to weird music amid the ambient announcements of delays and question our place in the universe.\n\nInspired by long travel and the stream of consciousness it fosters, Glitchhikers asks you to look inward. Find the answers to your questions and question the answers you receive. Ruminate on life, the universe, our place and purpose in it. Voyage through a freeform narrative experience, converse with the endless inevitability, and explore the cosmic, hopeful world you find yourself in.\n\nA follow up to the critically praised short game released in 2014, Glitchhikers: The Spaces Between is an expanded experience, reborn and reimagined.\n\nFEATURES\n• A freeform narrative journey\n• Through the spaces between destinations\n• Shared with a surreal cast of characters\n• And set to a weird soundtrack\n• The full realisation of the critically acclaimed cult game\n\nABOUT SILVERSTRING MEDIA\nFrom Avant Garde narrative designers Silverstring Media\nSilverstring Media are a vital and vibrant voice within narrative indie games, creating a string of short experimental titles and working as narrative guns for hire on indie darlings including Celeste, Crypt of the Necrodancer, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine, Manifold Garden and Wandersong.",
