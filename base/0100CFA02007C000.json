Complete Quests, collect items, and follow the Saint's trail to hear his story.\n\nThese stories are short and are not intended to take up much time to play through.

They are a light that leads us to Christ in every generation, a living Gospel. The ministry and very life of Christ is worked out in the lives of the Saints, His faithful servants. They are the glory of the Church, the God-bearers on earth and in heaven. Most of the saints were unknown to the world, but the Grace of God made them known to the whole universe and to all the ages.
