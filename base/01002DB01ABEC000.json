    "description": "The Ramsey is a 2D platformer with cute squirrel characters living on the planet Chipmars, comprised of six huge islands. Players can explore various areas by solving mazes and puzzles using the Cotton Gun, a special weapon wielded by the playable squirrel Ramsey that makes objects float in the air. Ramsey came to the Earth aboard a Space Running Wheel from the Chipmars from faraway across the space, and now shares tales of his adventures back home with his hamster friend, Cheese. Climate change caused by the greed of the evil inventor rendered all of the Chipmars near inhospitable to the native rodent population. Find out how Ramsey fought this catastrophe, and why he came to the Earth.",
