    "description": "Redout is a freakishly fast and uncompromising anti-gravity racing game, designed to be as challenging and satisfying as the best games in the vertigo-soaked futuristic arcade racing genre. Each turn, slope and twist applies a unique force to your vehicle, and players can drift and pitch the ship to minimize friction, channeling those forces into even greater forward velocity.\nThe courses combine the efficiency of low-polygon structure with the eye candy of state-of-the-art shading, lighting and special-effects animation. The result? Breezy coastlines, eerie frozen landscapes and vast desert plains, all peppered with the flying sparks, electrical arcs and blazing exhaust of Redout racing intensity.",
