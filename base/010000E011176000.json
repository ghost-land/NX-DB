    "description": "What is this game anyway?\nIf you are up for a casual yet spicy cocktail of action and strategy, but not planning to spend hours learning how to play, then Rover Wars might just be your thing.\n\nYou jump straight into the action with your little Rover to start building factories and hurting enemy units. The tactics in the game are in the resource management, and the placement and type of factories. Factories poop out minions that will find their way to the opposing buildings and destroy them. Once you destroy the enemy base, you win. simple.\n\nDon't just watch, join!\nRover Wars has a campaign mode and a battle mode. The campaign mode will keep the average player busy for about 2 hours. Instead of providing a deep story, the campaign focuses on challenging you incrementally. If you like you play the campaign in co-op.\n\nBesides the campaign there is also the battle mode. This allows you to battle in one of the 17 instantly available maps. Tweak many settings such as, base strength and AI intelligence.\n\nWill There be...\n*Explosions? Yes, lots of them!\n*Many maps? Yes, 17.\n*Local multiplayer? Yes, up to 8 players can join.\n*Different themes? Yes, we have a dusty Mars planet, a freezing \n  ice world and a mossy place to fight in.\n\nValue for money?\nAn average match takes about 5 to 20 minutes depending on the amount of players and the AI level. The game has good replay value and is, according to us and our testers, good fun to play with a bag of crisps and a few beers. If you would play the campaign with a friend the total man hours of fun would sum up to 4 hours. That means you paid about the same for the beer and the crisps as for the game. Unless you live in Finland.",
