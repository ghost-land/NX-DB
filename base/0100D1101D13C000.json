    "description": "MyRummy® is the modern version of the traditional card game Rummy, which gives it both its name and rules. MyRummy® itself has already become one of the essential classics.\nThe game is extremely easy to learn. Place your tiles and arrange them cleverly in runs and groups, bearing in mind their colours and numerical values. This continues round for round. Perhaps a joker could help you? Whoever is the first to use up all their tiles is the winner.\n\n• Simple rules\n• Balanced combination of strategy and luck\n• Choice of different settings\n• For up to 4 players",
