    "description": "Trapped inside the room full of screens is a pair of hands that can predict the future. Ask a question and draw the runes, and these hands will unveil the forthcoming. This is the future you live in, a small world, a city full of uncertainty and doubt, violence and obsession. In a time when people have begun to reject life as an unwanted burden, they'll have nothing to trust. They'll come, they'll seek, and you will give them answers.\n\nYou are the Diviner, an enigmatic fortune teller using ancient runes to discern the future even as the technology of a cyberpunk metropolis surrounds you. Converse with your clients to learn their stories, then arrange the runes they’ve drawn to decide the responses you give them. Good or bad, these answers hold the power to stir the fate of humans and robots alike, to change the outcome of this tale in meaningful ways, to deal in death or help your clients avoid it. The decisions and consequences are grey, requiring your intuition as Diviner to bring an end to the madness of a despairing populace.\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Immerse yourself in a cyberpunk setting illustrated in dark graphic novel style!\n• Meet a variety of clients seeking answers, some human and some robotic.\n• Arrange runes in a variety of ways to make your predictions.\n• Engage in meaningful dialogue that presents real-world issues through a sci-fi lens.\n• Decide the fate of each character and the populace via interwoven cause-and-effect!\n• Witness your impact on the world through TV screens and news reports.\n",
