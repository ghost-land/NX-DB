    "description": "Deadly and equally dangerous — that’s our nameless hero, who swore an oath to vanquish all the evildoers of this fantasy land! Armed with scythe and two automatic pistols, he will tolerate no one who stands in his way.\n\nDD is a new twin-stick action with high emphasis on dynamic combat, roguelike elements and neat pixel art style. This game gives you literally hordes of enemies and different tools to dispose of them. Cartoonish violence has never been so fun before — trust us, you gonna love shooting those pesky spiders and skeletons!\n",
