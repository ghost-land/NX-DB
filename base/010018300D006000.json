    "description": "Think outside the box to save a world in peril! As Qbby or Qucy, you’ll create boxes and use them to surmount more than 270 puzzling stages—the most in the series to date! The box planet is plagued with obstacles, so jump, climb, drift, ride, and warp your way past them in three modes, complete with their own stories, stages, challenges, and techniques. You can even team up for a 2-player adventure starring both star-crossed boxes!\n\nA Tale for Two is a new mode in which—for the first time in the series—two players can work together to solve puzzles… Or one brave player can alternate between Qbby and Qucy! On top of that, there’s a third adventure starring Qudy, the tall one, and thanks to his extra-tall boxes, you’ll even have to think outside the rectangle! As you beat stages, you’ll uncover more, and if you’re efficient, earn medals you can use to score everything from boxy accessories to simple comics to helpful items at the in-game shop. Got your eye on a sweet sailor costume? Then try Balloon Challenge: if you get all ten balloons before the time runs out, you’ll score extra medals!",
