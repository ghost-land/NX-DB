    "description": "Cheeky monsters everywhere! Place your explosives strategically on stacks of crates, scaffolding and logs where the little critters are sitting. Light the fuse and bring them all down! \nWhat looks simple at first gets more and more demanding: The cheeky little guys won't keep still – and they just keep coming! With the explosions you'll have to take into account chain reactions, movement behaviour, tilt directions and much more. Got enough bombs? Rake in trophies and defeat the monsters!\n\n• Tricky and funny physics game \n• 50 levels with an increasing level of difficulty\n• Lovingly drawn environments\n• Simple gameplay with lots of challenges",
