With the explosions you'll have to take into account chain reactions, movement behaviour, tilt directions and much more. Got enough bombs? Rake in trophies and defeat the monsters!\n\n• Tricky and funny physics game \n• 50 levels with an increasing level of difficulty\n• Lovingly drawn environments\n• Simple gameplay with lots of challenges",
