    "description": "You start as a small dragon in a serene forest. You wake up and talk to forest dwellers and they will send you to your first destination. Take off and fly forward and you will be gently guided by the environment and kind strangers will tell you where to head next.\n\nEnjoy the sensation of flying as well as exploring the giant environments, discovering hidden paths, and chatting with helpful people. Utilize your fire breath to burn down spider webs and human constructs to clear the way forward.",
