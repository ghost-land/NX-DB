Sausage, egg, tuna – everything you can think of… Check with Boo what other surprises are waiting for you, and be aware of the item shape, because every “golf ball” bounces differently. \n\n\nMORE THAN AN ORDINARY GOLF ROUND\nYou won’t experience only casual levels in this game. Running away from enormous basketball or defending your friends from danger as a hot dog. Not to mention traps on your way like falling crates, moving knives or even bursts of pressure.\n\n\nGO WITH THE FLOW\nAfter you complete a certain amount of levels, you will earn a badge. It allows you to track your progress, and make a step forward into collecting all the trophies! Kung will be proud if you can make your collection extra shiny.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- 4 well-known, adorable characters like Tary or Ta\n- Over 70 challenging levels to beat\n- 60 FPS on Nintendo Switch™ console\n- Funky and twirky soundtrack\n- Lots of humor and funny scenarios",
