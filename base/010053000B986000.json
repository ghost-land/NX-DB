The race is on. \n\nTo succeed, you’ll have to fight your way across the country, through both friendly and rival gang territory, with whatever weapons you can get your hands on: swords, shotguns, baseball bats, sledge hammers, pipe bombs, and so much more. \n\nYou’ll need to use what you earn and learn along the way to upgrade yourself, your ride, and your weapons. The path to glory and riches is a long one paved in blood and pain, but luckily you’ve got a fast bike. \n\nStart Your Engines\n\nRoad Redemption is an action racing game where you lead your motorcycle gang on an epic journey of pursuit, blood, and speed.
