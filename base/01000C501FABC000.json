    "description": "For years, the Vick family has been obsessed with the mysteries hidden within the great Pyramids of the Valley of the Kings. Pharaoh’s Secret will test your ability to solve intricate puzzles and come out unscathed from multiple encounters with murderous mummies and traps lurking around every corner. Use different objects to unlock doors, break walls... Find a way to reach elevated areas by using boxes that you can move from one point to another, or blow up dynamite cartridges to unlock impassable walls. Use sarcophagi to hide from Anubis soldiers and look for fire torches to avoid attacks from mummies and other beings that inhabit the deep tombs of the Pharaohs. You have decided to enter their dark and dangerous corridors in search of treasures and riches, but escaping won’t be that easy.",
