    "description": "Developed by Digital Sun, creators of Moonlighter, The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story™ is an action RPG that takes place in the League of Legends universe. In the kingdom of Demacia, the Mageseekers hold the power to oppress magic-using citizens in the name of public order–by inducting and indoctrinating them, locking them away, or driving them into hiding.\n\nPlay as Sylas, a spell-stealing mage who has just broken free of his unjust captivity at the Mageseekers’ hands. Wielding the chains that once bound you, you must liberate your homeland from tyranny, one Mageseeker at a time.\n\nIt’s time to unshackle the magic.\n\nCommand the Magic\nMagic is everywhere, including on the battlefield. From searing flames to deadly ice, master a variety of spells and customize your unique play style. Brandish your chains and use your enemies’ magic against them, or bash them with your fists–the choice is yours.\n\nRaise a Rebellion\nDemacia is ripe for a revolution, but can you rise to the challenge of leading it? It’s up to you to find mages across the land and recruit them to your cause. Harness the power of your growing army to upgrade your base and unlock unique abilities.\n\nForge Your Legacy\nYou see the Mageseekers for the criminals they are, but not everyone is ready for the truth. Battle formidable foes and align with unforgettable allies, both new and old. Only you can uncover the buried secrets of Demacia’s past, and use them to change the course of its future.",
