    "description": "Welcome to the ultimate showdown of thumb dexterity, whippiness and cunning! In Kumi-Daiko Beatoff, you control a mask who is forever tied to a drum with a whippy string. This drum is not only an instrument that makes a fun sound, but a formidable weapon when coming into contact with other masks at high speeds! Up to four players can join in on the drum-spinning fun, clearing the playing field of angry red masks together or seeing who’s who in last-mask-standing Battles. Avoid getting hit by other masks & have fun whackin’ it out with everyone you love!\n\nSurvival Mode (1-4 players):\nDestroy as many Tengu masks as you can, alone or cooperatively with friends!\n\nBattle Mode (2-4 players):\nFight against other players, evading their drums and trying to hit them with yours!",
