    "description": "\"An Eye for Immortalityâ€¦ What a terrible price to pay for such a terrible curse!\"\n\nDungeons of Shalnor is a tactical Roguelike game. It features a Turn-Based combat along with a \"Turn the camera\" mechanic that also turns all monsters and projectiles, causing interesting outcomes such as: Monsters walking into traps; or attacking one another.\n\nThere are many different types of monsters, and each move and behave differently in puzzle-like patterns. \n\nEvery time you die, your gold is transformed into Ghost Coins, which can be used to purchase permanent Upgrades in the Spirit Shop.
