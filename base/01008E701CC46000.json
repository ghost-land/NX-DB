Your ball shatters to pieces and you have to start your fall all over again. \n\nEven traps platforms are no match for a fireball falling at full speed! Choose your strategy: speed up like a madman or stop and wait for your next chance to roll and jump!\n\nIf you don't want to play solo, choose a multiplayer mode for up to 4 players and compete with your friends or family.
