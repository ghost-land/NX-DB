With the help of a scanner, Myrah will sell biological information for ship, suit and weapon upgrades.\n \nInside Myrah’s vessel, players will engage in random encounters with real-time space combat, trade with other travelers across the galaxy and navigate outer space with Morphite’s easy-to-use Starmap system.",
