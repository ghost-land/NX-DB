    "description": "Oce is a drop of dew, that comes from the pronunciation of Hindi dew.\n\nOce went out as usual, but this time it was very strange, the space vortex suddenly appeared, taking Oce to a new space.\n\nIt â€™s weird here, not only has the gravity rules changed, but it is also full of triggers and traps!\n\nHowever, Oce will not sit still but flee from here!\n\nChallenge gravity\nGravity has changed, standing on some special places will change the gravity, but it also brings advantages to break through.\nAdapt to the change of gravity, which is the key to escape.\n\nFind triggers\nThe trigger may be hidden somewhere, and it can help Oce to move forward smoother\n\nAvoid traps\nGravity can help, but also hurt.\nBe careful of the traps and sharp blades around, this is the biggest threat to Oce.\n\nHas score?\nMaybe it was Oce's dream? Or space was in disorder again?\nChallenge the dangerous space more times, just get your best score!\n\nAnyway, leave this strange and dangerous place as soon as possible!",
