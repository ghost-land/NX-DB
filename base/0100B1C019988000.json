But as the lighting dims and frames diminish, with the world on the brink of extinction, hope emerges to fight back. \n\nAs the most hideous pixelated hero to ever spawn in Nostalgaia, you must fight through an army of its mindless inhabitants, while being jeered by a cynical narrator who despises your very existence.\n\nFeaturing hard but fair combat that fans of the genre will relish, along with *full character customization, unique battle armor and engaging narrative mechanics rich in lore, The Last Hero of Nostalgaiaâ€™s twisted and wicked tale is prepared to send you headfirst into almost certain death around its every vertex.\n\n- Set in a world celebrating video game nostalgia, The Last Hero of Nostalgaia features hard but fair souls-like exploration and combat, combined with a twisted, wicked tale told by a cynical narrator\n- Play together through online co-op and brave the pixelization together!\n- Uncover various suits of armor and weapons, each with their own unique lore and attributes",
