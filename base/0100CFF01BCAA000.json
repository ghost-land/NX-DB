    "description": "This reimagined version for up to four players offers you a modern and addictive gameplay, fantastic graphics, great sounds, lots of levels and many underwater characters.\n\nYou are a very ambitious little fish … surrounded by the gulping underwater crowd! These are nasty, sneaky, big-mouthed aquatic devils that would swallow you up in no time … plus the real-slick, fast-turning sharks and other enemies as well that just love keeping you in their stomachs. But you´re smarter … and sly-mouthed too! … and why let them DEVOUR you?\n\nIn SHARK! SHARK!® you control a fish! Your goal is to earn as many points as possible while staying alive. Swimming in the ocean with you are other fish of various sizes, lobsters, crabs, jellyfish, kraken, puffer fish, orca, electric eel, and a very fast shark. You are able to eat any fish that is smaller in size than you are, and any fish that is larger will eat you! The shark can also be defeated if you nibble at its tail several times, but be careful for the shark can turn quickly. And be also aware of the lobster, crab, kraken, puffer fish, orca, and the electric eel. Each time you eat a fish or nibble on the shark´s tail, points are earned. When some shells on the bottom open, you have to be quick and collect the pearls inside. Each time you score, your fish will grow larger in size allowing you to eat even more of the fish on the screen. \n\nThe original version of SHARK! SHARK!® was launched 1982. The game was developed by game development pioneer Don Daglow and Ji-Wen Tsao, the world´s first female game console programmer. SHARK! SHARK!® was selected by the National Game Preservation Board as one of the best video games for permanent maintenance in the United States Library of Congress National Game Registry.
