Harness the power of gravity to your advantage and overcome dangers on your way in this arcade platformer mixed with puzzle elements.\n\n\nTWO PLAYABLE CHARACTERS\nThe titular character Wira is a powerful warrior wielding a massive hammer capable of defeating enemies standing in the way. On the other hand, Taksa is characterized by extraordinary speed and agility. It allows him to evade traps and overcome various time-based challenges.\n\n\nCHALLENGING JOURNEY\nWira and Taksa share the same life pool. If you run out of lives, the level will restart. Keep an eye out for life tokens along your journey to increase the number of your attempts. Remember that monsters inflict minor damage, while traps such as spikes or flames will defeat the heroes instantly.\n\n\nDIVERSE LOCATIONS\nAs you progress through the levels you will discover the variety of locations. The calm forests will transform into fiery landscapes, and then they will be shrouded in darkness. Each one contains a different set of traps and obstacles. Switch your character based on the situation and adapt yourself to the current objective.",
