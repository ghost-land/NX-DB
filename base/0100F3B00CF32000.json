    "description": "Death Coming is a non-linear puzzle game where you take on the role of the Reaper. Your sole objective? Cause deaths and harvest souls while abiding by the Free Will Clause.\n\nYou Died. \nPure and simple, but death was not the end. You have become an agent of Death: a Reaper. You have the powers of Death, but there are rules in this supernatural afterlife.\n\nThe Reaper ends lives, but it cannot control humans directly due to the Free Will Clause. As the Reaper, you must plan and execute your killings by using the environment to your advantage. In the meantime, be wary of Minions of Light, who will try to save humans from their grim fate!",
