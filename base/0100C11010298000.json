It can be your tool or a weapon you use to smash others in a series of fast paced ground busting arenas. \n\nChoose from a variety of heroes\nDress them up (or down) and combine outfits to look fabulous on your way to victory.  \n\nDuel it out in a variety of exhilarating multiplayer modes \nUp to four friends or strangers can show off their skills as they go head to head at full speed, battling for victory, for honor - and of course bragging rights.\n\nMore thinker than a fighter? \nNo worries! Try some precision ground manipulation in co-op, against a friend, against an enemy, or a friend who is your enemy, or if you don’t have any friends or enemies (good for you!) you can go lone wolf in the story mode.\n\nBust your way through 6 fantastical worlds\n30+ levels, 300+ stages, each based on a unique theme. \n",
