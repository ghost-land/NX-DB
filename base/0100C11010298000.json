    "description": "Steal the ground right from under your enemies! or yourself! \nIn “Georifters” you can spin walls, twist tunnels, crush critters, battle against the ground or with it! It can be your tool or a weapon you use to smash others in a series of fast paced ground busting arenas. \n\nChoose from a variety of heroes\nDress them up (or down) and combine outfits to look fabulous on your way to victory.  \n\nDuel it out in a variety of exhilarating multiplayer modes \nUp to four friends or strangers can show off their skills as they go head to head at full speed, battling for victory, for honor - and of course bragging rights.\n\nMore thinker than a fighter? \nNo worries! Try some precision ground manipulation in co-op, against a friend, against an enemy, or a friend who is your enemy, or if you don’t have any friends or enemies (good for you!) you can go lone wolf in the story mode.\n\nBust your way through 6 fantastical worlds\n30+ levels, 300+ stages, each based on a unique theme. \n",
