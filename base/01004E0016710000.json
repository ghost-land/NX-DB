    "description": "Each side of your wooden block features a different kind of shape and you can only roll onto a block with the corresponding shape and alignment. Rolling onto a circle allows you to rotate your cube, opening up branching pathways to help you achieve your goal. Teleporting, wildcards, and falling blocks all spice up the mix.\n\nComplimenting the gameplay is a relaxing melodic soundscape that evolves as you progress through the levels and aim to reach a state of zen.\n\nCan you achieve gold on all 121 levels?",
