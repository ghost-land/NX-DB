    "description": "\"Rampant ninja related crimes these days... Whitehouse is not the exception...\". As soon as that occurs, a Secret Service agent asks two street-smart brawlers, the \"Bad Dudes\" named Blade and Striker: \"President Ronnie has been kidnapped by the ninjas. Are you a bad enough dude to rescue Ronnie?\" After hearing that, the Bad Dudes pursue the Ninja's through the New York City streets, a moving big rig truck, a large storm sewer, a forest, a freight train on an old Southern Pacific line, a cave and into an underground factory in order to save President Ronnie.",
