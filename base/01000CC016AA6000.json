    "description": "Part One of the MSPA Reader Saga.\n\nWelcome to Hiveswap: Friendsim, a darkly comedic episodic visual novel set in the Homestuck/Hiveswap universe, created by American author and artist Andrew Hussie.\n\nYou’ve crash landed on a dangerous alien planet with no food, medicine, or prospects, but you do know one thing—you are absolutely desperate for friendship.\n\nTravel from grimy underground clubs to stately mansions, meeting trolls up and down the hemospectrum along the way.\nHiveswap Friendsim is a quick, loosely-canonical visual novel adventure following the efforts of the unnamed protagonist (that’s you!) to survive and maybe even thrive on the harsh surface of ALTERNIA.\n\nSet in the time of Hiveswap: Act 1 and featuring characters from Hiveswap: Act 2, this episodic visual novel is sure to satisfy Homestuck and Hiveswap fans who are eager for a darker stroll across the Alternian landscape.\n\nThis new release for Nintendo Switch™ includes all 18 volumes of the episodic series. It is available for purchase either standalone or in the Pestersim bundle, bringing together both Hiveswap Friendsim and its sequel, Pesterquest for the complete MSPA Reader Saga at a bargain price.",
