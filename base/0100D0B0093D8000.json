    "description": "The new TorqueL -Physics Modified Edition- has been released with updated physics following an update to the game engine, while still providing the same experience as the original TorqueL game.\n\nTorqueL is a curiously unique 2D rotation action game, in which you proceed by rotating or extending a box with characters inside.\nSometimes simply rotating or extending the box is not enough, and you have to find the right combination of rotating and extending to jump or climb over obstacles.\n\nPlayers progress through the game by guiding the box towards the goal in each Chamber. Some Chambers have multiple goals, and depending on which goals you reach, the game diverges into seven different routes. There also exists a secret route that can only be unlocked under certain conditions. To clear each route you must reach the coloured goal that appears at the end. The seven basic routes and one secret route equal a total of fifty Chambers all together for you to challenge.\n\nThe game also features original music composed by sanodg to accompany you as you play through the game.\nHD rumble will also allow you to feel which direction the box extends in.",
