But you won't allow it.\n\nFight of waves of enemies, each consisting of at least 50 turns. Each turn you can collect connected tiles which will yield rewards depending on their type:\n\nPotions heal you and might even yield you a powerful healing potion that you might use whenever you need it.\n\nShields will replenish your armor and count towards your loot value.
