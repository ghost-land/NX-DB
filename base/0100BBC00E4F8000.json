    "description": "“Need a packet?” is a horror-simulator about supermarket cashier, who is gradually losing her mind from routine work. She starts to feel that the cash register is turning into a medieval tower, while dragons and chimeras are flying around and trying to kill Molly.\n\nEvents take place on the background of a garbage crisis in the city. Grounds are rotting, recycling factories are overcrowded, water is poisoned and citizens start to disappear in the local forests.\n\n“Beep Beep Beep” – that's what you'll hear in your head all day after playing “Need a packet?”. Go crazy!",
