    "description": "It's a puzzle action strategy game with some lovely contraptions to really make you ponder. A beautifully balanced mix of difficulty and fun.\n\nThe game revolves around getting little balls from the emitter to their home in the goal. Blocking their way are a heap of obstacles and some helpful elements coloured red or blue. So simple ... yet so tricky.",
