    "description": "Hello Goodboy is a heartwarming, wholesome adventure featuring Iko, a boy new to the afterlife. With no memory of what brought him to the world beyond, he must rely on Coco, a strangely familiar dog who will help him solve the mysteries of this new existence. \n\nJourney through unknown, yet familiar places, meeting fellow souls on their own adventures through the afterlife. Pay it forward with generous favors for them and try to figure out just why Iko landed in the land beyond to begin with. However, mind the time: there's only so much of it!\n\n- Craft a personal fairy tale atmosphere and a heartwarming story, as Iko and Coco make their way through the afterlife.\n- Unravel mysteries and collect bundles of joy\n- Give endless bellyrubs to Coco along the way!\n\nBefriend the dozens of denizens in the afterlife like a lonely child, an anxious couple, an overworked lumberjack, and more. Everyone has a story to tell and a task Iko can help with. After you help them through their problems, break out the comfort food and relax together.\n\nBut you only have so much time. Decide who you spend time with, as visiting some will prevent you from making relationships with others, and discover how your choices will affect Iko's story through multiple endings.\n\n- Coco is the closest friend in the afterlife anyone could ask for - also the best of boys! \n- His nose combined with Iko's fixing skills will be key to discovering the metaphysical mysteries found around the world beyond.\n- Pamper him with bellyrubs and playing with toys to keep his “Goodboy-o-meter” fulfilled.",
