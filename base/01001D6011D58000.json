    "description": "In this steampunk setting, you will play as a young engineer on his first day of work. A young man finding a job? As you can see, everything is possible in video games! The problem is that the mine you work on is about to collapse. Luckily, this budding engineer has the Scarabeus, a steam-powered, rolling vehicle that is loaded with qualities. And he will need all of them because just before starting his escape he realizes that there are other people trapped in that mining hell.\n\nAt the controls of his incredible machine, the protagonist will be able to explore the environment and solve the puzzles that block his way. As it happens with mini-golf, that involves aiming and measuring your trajectory with precision. You will also have to use different steam balls to solve many challenging puzzles. Thanks to these balls you can cause explosions to destroy obstacles or create ramps and walls in order to have an easier time down there. There is no doubt that the Scarabeus will be a vital ally in escaping alive from the depths of the mine. Can you handle the pressure?",
