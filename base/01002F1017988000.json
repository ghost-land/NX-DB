    "description": "Dr. Oil is a bit hardcore 2D platforming experience that tells a story of a conflict between the butter boy and the seagull.\n\nThis story is heavy influenced by the popular fairy tales that you loved to hear so much as youngsters before the sleep. Once upon a time there was a boy who lived in a fabled and distant kingdom.  One day he was bitten by a seagull and therefore he turned into the Captain Seagull. Hatred and darkness filled the heart of that boy, and he became evil because all seagulls are evil!\n\nThough he's not our hero. Our hero today is a slice of butter named Doctor Oil. Dr. Oil is a bit evil as well, but not as evil as any seagull! This brave and tiny dairy product just hates the sounds of seagulls, and so he decides to kill Captain Seagull by his own hand. This desire becomes the possible future that will last for the 75 stages from 5 different worlds! By the way, we have a wonderful trailer here as well, so be sure to watch it just after you'll buy this game!\n\nThanks everyone!",
