    "description": "You take on the role of manager at a small (but growing!) talent agency. As you cultivate and train the newest generation of young pop stars, you'll have to decide who to hire and who to fire, who gets promoted and who gets reprimanded. The personal lives of these young celebrities are a part of your business, and the life of a pop star isn't always sunshines and rainbows. Their crowning personal achievements can be your greatest commercial successes, but their emotional meltdowns and PR nightmares can spell financial disaster for your company.\nIt's not just the idols you have to worry about. The world is full of gossip magazines, super fans, and rival groups, all thirsty for a scoop on the latest scandal. There's a lot of people who want to tear you down and are willing to play dirty, but try not to let it get to you. It's nothing personal, it's just business.\n\n■Idol Training\nProvide voice training and dance lessons to the idols you have scouted, and train them to become top-notch idols. Do you want a cool group or a cute group? Will the office control what they post on social networking sites? Or how long should their skirts be? You decide.\n\n■CD Production\nLyrics, musical arrangement, choreography, number of singers per group, who will be front and center? The players themselves will have to make the tough decisions, produce the music and CD, and then release it. Of course, watch how much funds you have before you end up in the red!\n\n■Advertising Activities\nYour Idol’s work isn't just to sing and dance in concerts. They may appear in magazines, TV, or livestreams on the Internet. Take on a wide variety of media outlets to increase your fan base!\n\n■Office Management\nIn addition to releasing single CDs, you can freely operate a cafe, theater, general elections, program production, and many other types of businesses. However, there is a limit to your funds. Be careful to not become a shoestring operation and watch your revenue!\n\n■Complicated human relations\nIdol management is fraught with problems, such as scandals, media manipulation, and interpersonal relation issues between idol group members and outsiders. To avoid risks, form good relationships and aim for smooth office management.\n\n■Fascinating Story\nThe story is set in the Japanese entertainment industry, and there are many events outside the main storyline. You can even marry your idol! How this story ends, is entirely up to you.\n\n■Free Play Style\nFree play with no storyline can also be used to avoid random events and love scandals. There are two unique difficulty levels: \"Relaxed,\" where you cannot go bankrupt, and \"Unfair,\" which makes it more difficult for players to make ends meet.\n\nOvercome various obstacles and create the best idol agency in Japan from the ground up!",
