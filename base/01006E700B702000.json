Inside the package she \nfinds an artifact, and instantly assailants descend on the museum \nto rob her. The artifact is stolen. Sarah lowers her head in disbelief \nas she realizes that again she is falling headfirst into a nightmare \nfrom the deep. \n\nNext Sarah finds herself on the shores of Kingsmouth, a forgotten \nfishing town which holds an incredible secret. A would-be \nmessenger reveals the sad truth: he and the rest of the town’s \ndenizens are suffering from a curse that is gradually turning them \ninto ghoulish, mutated ocean creatures… a curse that was cast by \nnone other than the mayor, Murray, and the old sea-devil himself, \nDavy Jones.
