Learn their patterns and discover their weakness before they lay their hands on you.\n\nEXCITING PROGRESSION: Be responsible for rebuilding and maintaining your guild's village. Meet new characters, choose your traps, your weapons and keep track of your discoveries and unlocked content.\n\nHANDCRAFTED & PROCEDURAL GENERATION: Designed to make each new run a completely new experience. Each room is handcrafted to get the most out of the combat, but you'll never explore the same dungeon twice.",
