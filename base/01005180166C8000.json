Isabella, dubbed the \"nerd\" of the school, is being bullied by Oakley, a problematic kid in her grade. Taylor struggles with his grades, anxiety, and pressure from his family to do well in school. London is navigating depression and grief, while trying to keep up with her job as a middle school teacher.\n\nLearn each character's fears and face off against bullies, hurled insults, inner demons, grade monsters & more. Seek comfort in each character's favorite item. Confront your biggest enemy - the worst bully, or your inner self!\n\nShredded Secrets builds empathy, manifesting human issues through interesting and charming gameplay.\n\nAbout the Development Team:\nShredded Secrets was created by Team Sarcastic Shark Clouds, a group of middle school girls at the 2018 Girls Make Games Seattle Summer Camp.
