Crash through doors, dodge bullets and turn the weapons of the fallen into your personal arsenal. Do whatever it takes reach the top.\n\nLondon, New Year's Eve 1999. While everyone is getting ready to party the metropolitan police are working overtime. Detective Inspector Redfern finds herself at the scene of an emerging arms trade at the foot of a high-rise tower. Without the permission of her superiors or the support of backup, Redfern prepares to go kick off the millennium with a bang.\n\nHigh-Rise, Higher Stakes. Ascend the dangerous gang infested tower, taking on tougher goons as you advance. The higher you get the higher the stakes.\n\nHigh Calibre. The three magazines of 9mm you brought with you were never going to get you past the first floor. Chop and change from your ever-expanding arsenal to suit the task at hand as you defeat enemies along the way.\n\nPerks of the Job. Customise your loadout with a series of performance enhancing perks and upgrades. Modify your skills as the night unfolds. \n\nDouble Trouble. It wouldn’t be a buddy cop shooter without a partner by your side. Call in a co-op ride-along, either local or online. It is all down to you (and your partner) to bring the whole lot of them down, in the only way you can… kicking doors and shooting bad guys!",
