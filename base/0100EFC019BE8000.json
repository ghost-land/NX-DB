Now he finds himself presented with yet another incredible, adoring woman.\n\nWill Hiroki’s relationship with princess Stephania of Astoria work out? It’s hard being so popular!\n\nFeatures \n* Sixth installment in Sakura Succubus series\n* Visual novel\n* Beautiful manga art\n* Gorgeous women to romance",
