    "description": "Stripping away modern complexities to return to a simpler, more challenging style of gaming, Ball laB is a straightforward precision platformer presented in minimalistic greyscale pixel art graphics. Each puzzling stage fills a single screen, with the objective being to get from one end of the level to another without falling victim to spikes, pitfalls or other hazards.\n\nYou play as a ball. You can roll along flat surfaces, bounce to ledges, hop onto platforms or ride elevators to reach your goal. If you hit a hazard, you’ll instantly respawn at the beginning of the stage, adding to your death counter with each attempt. How many tries will it take for you to clear all 60 challenges?\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Roll and bounce through single-screen stages.\n• Master 60 levels of hardcore challenge!\n• Enjoy minimalistic greyscale presentation with a focus on tight gameplay.\n• Avoid spikes and other hazards!\n• Watch your death count climb in a rewarding loop of trial and error.\n• Respawn immediately to retry as many times as it takes!\n",
