    "description": "Collect the most riches to win this race! Don't hold back and don't be shy to push one or two pretenders into the ocean! What if they can't swim? It's all for a good cause, right? Your cause!\n\nHowever, the island is cursed to sink under the rising waters and soon everyone will die if none of you greedy bastards take the time to build the escape boat before the final wave. Of course, that hard working lad, doesn't have to be you. There's plenty of losers who don't really need those shiny diamonds!\n\nKeep an eye on who gets ahead and join the others to take down the leader and steal his booty! If by any miracle your party survives, you get to count your wealth and possibly win as the richest player. If greed gets the best of you and you all drown, well, then none of this matters... everyone will lose!\n\nTHE ADVENTURE\n\nNo true raider stops on the first win when so many treasures await him. A long series of lost islands are ready to be explored, one by one, in the most dangerous adventure. Your treasures will be summed up in the hideout, where you all return after each raid.\n\nCollect rare relics, discover their secrets, try your luck or make your own to and survive up till the end where all your hard work will be rewarded. But beware, a single misstep and the whole adventure will become an unfortunate story to scare the children.\n\nAnd don't forget, if you have a hard time, feeling poor and miserable, you can join forces with another sad raider and make a team. If you don't manage to do better, at least you'll have a shoulder to cry on.\n\nWIN ALONE OR DIE TOGETHER!\n\nGrab your friends and venture to the Lost Island! Seek your fortune, survive together and get rich in the process! Donâ€™t let greed get the best of you, or you'll be all sleeping with the fishes on the bottom of the ocean!",
