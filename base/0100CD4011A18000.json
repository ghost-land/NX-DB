Complete different types of driving missions as a taxi or private taxi driver and pick your favorite car from a selection of over 30 amazing vehicles.\n\nNavigate around huge cities like New York, Miami, Rome or Los Angeles and adjust your driving style to different types of clients - some are in a hurry and don’t care if you run a red light, while others are terrified of dangerous driving. \n\nWe take taxi simulation games to a new level with VIP clients, undecided clients and various types of daily and lifetime milestones.\n\nStart your taxi driving career with regular cars and work your way up to SUVs, luxury cars, sports cars and supercars. Buy better cars to be able to pick up VIP clients and to earn more for each mission. Each car you buy can be played both in taxi and private taxi mode.\n\nEnjoy the stunning graphics and environments in this open-world driving experience. We’ve added features you won’t find in any other taxi simulation games: pedestrians open umbrellas when it rains, there are hundreds of destructible objects, there is a realistic density of cars and people on the sidewalk.
