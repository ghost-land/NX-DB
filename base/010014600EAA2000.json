    "description": "Gurgamoth is the perfect mix of party chaos and competitive strategy, ideal for sitting around on the couch with a couple of friends.  \n\nYour only weapon is the level itself: a shifting battlefield with different hazards.  Gurgamoth is fast, relying on quick timing, but also your ability to read your opponent.  Will they dodge your attack and send you flying into a spinning saw blade?  Will they spend their attacks on a power up, leaving them temporarily vulnerable?  Will they anticipate your attack and stun you while you're recovering?\n\nGet inside their minds and earn the honor of awakening Gurgamoth.\n\n•Unique levels, each with their own dangers.\n•Game-changing power-ups.\n•Tight flying mechanics.\n•Fantastic visual design.\n•Fast, party-friendly matches.\n•Full controller support.\n•The most fun you'll have summoning an elder god.",
