    "description": "Experience the world of restaurant cooking in a highly polished, realistic kitchen. Use ovens, gas stands, pots, pans, bowls and plates, everything you need. Prepare dozens of lifelike ingredients - from vegetables through fish to steaks and poultry - to cook over 60 real dishes, or anything you like. \n\nThis is your kitchen. You can do anything here. \nIf you really don't want to, you don't even have to cook anything. Throw kitchen knives like darts. Set fire to cardboard boxes, cook a steak on them, and then save the day with a fire extinguisher. Build a tower out of pots and trays. Everything with real-life physics.\n\nHowever, if you'd rather be a cook, the same physics engine gives you unlimited opportunities. Cut some vegetables, put them in a pot and boil. Use a blender to make a soup. Bake a fish fillet, but remember not to burn it! See your ingredients transform with temperature. The kitchen experience awaits!",
