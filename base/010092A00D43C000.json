    "description": "The Talos Principle is a philosophical first-person puzzle game from Croteam, the creators of the Serious Sam series, and written by Tom Jubert (FTL, The Swapper) and Jonas Kyratzes (Infinite Ocean). Assume the role of a sentient artificial intelligence placed within a simulation of humanityâ€™s greatest ruins and linked together through an arcane cathedral. Players are tasked with solving a series of increasingly complex puzzles woven into a metaphysical parable about intelligence and meaning in an inevitably doomed world.\n\nKey Features:\n\n - Overcome more than 120 immersive puzzles in a stunning world.\n\n - Divert drones, manipulate laser beams and even replicate time to prove your worth - or to find a way out.\n\n - Explore a story about humanity, technology and civilization. Uncover clues, devise theories, and make up your own mind.\n\n - Choose your own path through the game's non-linear world, solving puzzles your way.\n\n",
