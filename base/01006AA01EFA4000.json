    "description": "Day in and day out, Nyanzou always looks like he’s up to something. Sure enough, this time he tells Kumakichi that he wants to open a restaurant. Kumakichi, thinking it’s the same old same old, shuts the idea down all cold and distant. Just when Nyanzou is taking a walk in a field at a loss of what to do, a shady shadow appears…\n\nThis time, Nyanzou & Kumakichi will run a restaurant! Kumakichi runs around cleaning up Nyanzou's mess. Will Nyanzou actually learn how to cook?!\n\nThis fresh new take on escape games is a hybrid of classic escape & cooking games. ",
