    "description": "Game goals:\nControl the soap, move, and dash to get to the soap holder. However, each time the soap is moved, its durability is reduced by friction with the floor. Please reach the soap holder before it loses its durability.\n\nFeature:\nOnline multiplayer: There are quick matches and friend matches, both of which you are free to enter and exit at any time. In Quick Match, soaps from all over the world are trying to reach the soap holder at their own pace. In Friend Match, you can easily play with specific friends only by using one keyword. Up to 10 players can play together. Of course, you can also play alone.\n\nSoap bubbles: When you use the dash, it increases your movement speed and produces soap bubbles. Because it's soap. Using soap bubbles with the soaps you're adventuring with is another fun way to make the stage look fantastic.\n\nThere is proof of life: Even when the soap wears itself out and ends its life, there will remain proof of your life (recovery items).\nOther soaps (players) will have your proof of life and will never forget your aspirations and your way of life. Maybe, just maybe, they will.\n\nCollection Item: After washing yourself with soap, you wipe yourself with a towel, right? Yes, you need a towel. Soap and towel are a set.\nThere is a towel somewhere on the stage. If you finish with a towel, your reputation will be high.\n\nGrowth System: Depending on the distance you move, your soap will become more and more durable and tougher.\nIt is the same with your mind. Never give up and keep going, and one day you will surely feel the growth.\n\nCheckpoint: Touch a checkpoint to respawn from it at any time. However, you will lose some life when you respawn.",
