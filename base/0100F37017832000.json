    "description": "When Bum-bo’s only coin is stolen by a mysterious entity and pulled down into the sewer, Bum-bo finds himself facing droves of deranged enemies, lost children, his fears and eventually the beast that stole his beloved coin.\n\nThe Legend of Bum-bo is a puzzle-based “deckbuilding roguelike.” Players collect hoards of items that can be modified, upgraded and combined with others in many interesting ways. Play as one of many Bum-bo, each with its own unique abilities, as they smash, bash and splash their way through a variety of cardboard monstrosities, giant bosses and dark personal urges. . .\n\n. . .oh, and it’s also the prequel to The Binding of Isaac!",
