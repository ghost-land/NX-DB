    "description": "Help!\n\nDarkness has fallen on the kingdom. Vile creatures now roam the land they seek to conquer.\n\nOur good king has been imprisoned, and his subjects robbed of their gold by the evil Ogre. He's the strongest monster of them all! But thankfully he's not that bright - you can outwit him!\n\nWatch your step, as the road ahead is filled with traps and obstacles. No one is safe in the dungeons, and you will have to face it all - merciless monsters, wraiths and more!\n\nGood luck!",
