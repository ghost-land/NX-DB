    "description": "InfiniteCorp is a decision-based strategy card game set in a fictional cyberpunk world. You are an employee of a corporation dealing in goods distribution and logistics in the “megatower” – the place where all local citizens live. Join a world where the stakes are high, and morality is blurred.\n\nThe world is in your hands. Choose the right strategy and make the right decisions. There are many choices – each has a definite impact on citizens’ lives. Make sure that “megacorporations” maintain an influence on the world’s operation and the lives of citizens. Corporations deal with specific fields and want to earn the highest possible profit. They do not care about their customers or their employees.\n\nEvery week of your career brings another important, seemingly random request from your unpredictable city as you strive for a balance between the elites, citizens, media, criminal overlords, and security. How will you treat the sick and wounded? You just need to know what side you're on.\n",
