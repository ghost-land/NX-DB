    "description": "Summum Aeterna is a Roguelite game that combines world crawler mechanics never seen before in the genre with a fast-paced combat system and a unique 2D art style.\n\nTaking the role of the King of Darkness, a mighty, powerful, and badass warlord condemned to eternal life, you'll explore uncharted worlds populated with treasures, traps, hordes of enemies and powerful bosses.\n\nExplore wild territories, descend into the most dangerous deeps of Aeterna, and fight your way to the end of each world... If you can!\n\nClassic Roguelite vibes\n\nThe King of Darkness may be immortal... But he can still be defeated. You will start your adventure over and over again, that's how this kind of games works, right? Don't panic, even if you're defeated, you still keep some of the stuff and upgrades you earned the last time you lived... Some of them, at least.\n\nSummum Aeterna allows players to keep their progress, featuring a permanent character and world upgrade system. No matter how many times you’re defeated, your progression in the skill tree will be saved, as well as the world improvements you unlocked will last forever.\n\nRandom worlds\n\nSummum Aeterna includes a unique world generator system never seen before in the genre, the Seed Mechanic... Each one generates a unique world with different enemy behavior, special events, and even a larger map size, depending on the rarity and the genes contained in the germinated seed.\n\nThe world modifiers, so-called “seed genes” are positive and negative attributes included in each seed you find. They will determine the dangers, encounters and rewards waiting for you once you start playing. You can generate the world that best suits your playstyle.\n\nSeeds create worlds and genes make each seed different from the last, and so will the worlds generated from them!\n\nBrutal fast-paced combat\n\nThe key to surviving in Summum Aeterna is killing every single living (or undead, depending on the enemy) being you encounter. How to achieve that? Well, you play as a cursed monarch… Your weapons are crafted for a king!\n\nShow no mercy, use your swords, pistols, and scythes to make them beg for their miserable lives before they do the same to you... You will choose a starting weapon at the beginning of each world, but you can switch it for a better one, whatever its type... It’s up to you and your skills!\n\nSummum Aeterna also includes weapon customization options thanks to the gems, precious stones that increase weapon attributes and add cool upgrades. Add new offensive and passive capabilities and improve the combat performance of your weapons by embedding gems. You can also ascend your weapons to Summum level and unchained their true power by collecting specific diagrams!\n\nCustom adventures\n\nIn Summum Aeterna you can define your own adventure. Each world will give you lots of rewards, including new seeds and currencies to upgrade your character skills, unlock new weapons, make the ones you already have even more deadly and, of course, improve the world's attributes.\n\nYou can unlock new special rooms, increase the rarity of the ítems you find, and alter the world conditions by the world upgrade menu. You can also modify the rarity of your current seeds by mutating their genes, or recycling the ones you don't want to get a seed with higher rarity...\n\nMultiplayer leaderboard\n\nSummum Aeterna features an interesting multiplayer and cross-platform feature, the so-called \"Board of Champions\".This mechanic records the highest level seed completed in the shortest time possible by each competitor. There is a leaderboard for influenced seeds and another one for standard seeds.\n\nThe reward for being in the top 3 places in the qualifier will be a gold, silver or bronze crown, which his highness will wear in-game regardless of the player's skin, and as long as the player remains on the podium. Do you want your King of Darkness to be crowned as every monarch deserves?",
