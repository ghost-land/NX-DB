    "description": "Numbala takes you on an adventure to save your dog friend while chasing the mysterious space whale in this beautiful, award-winning space shooter. Learning maths should be fun. It is the game that can give your child an edge at school!\n\nNumbala is more than a game for children. It is a cognitive training designed to teach kids mathematics. As we first learn about numbers, our minds create the so-called mental numeric axis. It is the way the human mind arranges numbers in space in relation to each other. \n\nIt is the basis of all mathematics further on and… it can be trained! As you move your finger on the control panel in Numbala, or move your Joy-Con™, your mind creates a connection between a number and its position in space. Thus, your ability to add and subtract numbers is being improved without you even noticing the process.\n\nThe game has been designed in cooperation with neuroscientists and tested on more than one hundred children. Having played Numbala, they have shown an improvement in response time and response correctness.",
