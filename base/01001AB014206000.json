    "description": "What’s “Tiny Lands” exactly?\nHave you ever played the old puzzle games in which you had to find all the differences? Well…Tiny Lands extract the basic concept but it goes out of the traditional method of finding differences.\n\nWhat makes it different from traditional “Find the differences” games?\nUsually, these types of games have the typical 2D view in which you only have to see and compare static images and clicking. Everything is different here; let us summarize what makes Tiny Lands so special:\n\nYou play in a 3D environment, which means you will be able to interact with the scene view to find all differences.\n\nDynamic objects, there are things like fire, rain, thunder, snow, the wind that are adding a charming feeling where you are playing.\n\nThe environment, if you are playing in a beach scene you will hear the beautiful and relaxing sound of waves coming and going out…the song of seagulls...This is very refreshing...\n\nNo time, you don’t have to worry about how much time you spend in a level you can just set your favorite lo-fi music and play this game at your own pace.\n\nNo lives, anyone can make mistakes, isn’t it? So why punish people for that, this is a game to grab a cup of coffee on a rainy day and just chill out.\n\n",
