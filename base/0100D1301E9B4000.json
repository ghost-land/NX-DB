    "description": "\"In this super minimal action runner, you’ll be jumping over obstacles with the tap of a button. But this is not a regular platformer! The entire level can change direction or flip upside down to throw you off. Are you skilled enough to survive every challenge?\n\nFeatures:\n• Simple one-button gameplay inside mind-bending geometry\n• 7 randomly generated levels for endless replayability\n• Unique and pumping chiptune soundtrack\n• Near impossible challenges to unlock player customizations\"",
