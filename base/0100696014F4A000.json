    "description": "Become Ryu Hayabusa, the ninja who inherited the \"Dragon Sword\", a legendary blade, and once again experience high-speed ninja action in which you face battles all over the world. The game is also packed with additional features such as \"Hero Mode\", a mode in which the player will guard automatically when they are in a pinch.\n\n■In \"NINJA RACE\", life or death depends on speed\n\"NINJA RACE\" is a mode in which you must race across the map within the time limit while fighting high-speed battles. In this mode, the number of enemies you defeat in succession is counted as your \"Kill Combo\", and by stringing together a high Kill Combo, your attack power will increase dramatically. Also, you can pick up speed-up and time increasing items along the way, so attacking non-stop, defeating enemies as fast as possible, and gathering items will be essential to your strategy.\n\n■Along with Hayabusa, 3 heroines dazzlingly dash about the battlefield\nHeroines from the \"NINJA GAIDEN\" series, \"Ayane\", \"Rachel\", and \"Momiji\" appear as playable characters. With \"TAG MISSIONS\", players can select 2 characters from among Hayabusa and the 3 heroines, allowing them to switch between 2 playable characters as they complete their mission.\n\nNote: This product is included in \"NINJA GAIDEN: Master Collection\", and \"NINJA GAIDEN: Master Collection Deluxe Edition\". It is not available for individual purchase.",
