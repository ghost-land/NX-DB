    "description": "Throw your hat to attack, defend and bait opponents. But watch out! If someone jumps on your hat... you die!\n\nIn King of the Hat, your hat contains your soul. Crush your opponent’s hats (and souls) to assert your dominance over them.\n\nWhen you throw your hat, it goes on fire and becomes invulnerable. You can use it to beat the devil out of other players or to defend against your opponents’ flaming hats.\n\nAlthough the basic mechanics are easy to pick up and play, King of the Hat allows for deep, hat-tastic competitive play as a 2 player game.\n\nChange the rules, add power ups and play around level hazards to create the hat-based madness you've always dreamed of.",
