    "description": "A deadly famine broke out in an ancient kingdom. Wells dried up, livestock died, and the earth turned as deadly as the plague itself. Whispers spread stories about an ancient evil reawakening in the mountains looking down upon the kingdom. An ancient evil who knew only war and famine. But who shall be so brave, so insane, so vain, as to try and best the creatures that live beyond for glory and adulation?\n\nTraumatarium is a randomly generated dungeon crawler for the classic handheld console. Fight your way through unlocking the great evil plaguing the lands by defeating the four denizens of the forbidden dungeons. Each trip down will be different. So pack your supplies, grab your favorite implement of destruction, and defeat the evils casting a shadow a plague of sorrow over the land before itâ€™s too late.\n\nInspired by the Fighting Fantasy books of old, and pushing the graphical limitations of the classic handheld console, Traumatarium is a callback to the old days of catching street-lamps in the back of your parents car!\n\nA nostalgic experience that can also be played in vertical mode with touch controls to better match the 90's feeling! Play with classic green color mode, choose between multiple color palettes or play with full colored mode!",
