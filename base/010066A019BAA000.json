    "description": "When an agent of the B.P.R.D. goes missing, Hellboy is sent to investigate; pulling him into the depths of the Wyrd.\n\nPlay the Comics\nDeveloped by Upstream Arcade, Hellboy Web of Wyrd utilizes an art style faithful to Mike Mignola’s original masterpieces. Like in the comics, the game sends Hellboy on a series of vastly different and wholly-unique adventures; and while each story stands on its own, they are all tied to the mysterious legacy of The Butterfly House.\n\nWelcome to the Wyrd\nBuilt in 1962 by occultist Pasquale Deneveaux, The Butterfly House is more than a mere residence; it’s a gateway. Built upon occult ley-energies, its strange angles and non-Euclidean geometries were designed with a singular foul purpose in mind: to open doorways into a terrible and fascinating dimension called The Wyrd.\n\nRoguelike Action Brawler\nGo toe-to-toe (or hoof-to-hoof) with a menagerie of nightmarish creatures and homunculi as you explore the realms within the Wyrd. Combat has been engineered to create challenging encounters that encourage you to learn patterns, dodge, parry, and - of course - punch your enemies into oblivion.",
