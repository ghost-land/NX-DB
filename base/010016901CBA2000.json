    "description": "«Where to, army man? Want to visit Kuznetsk? Yes, I can drive you till the road to it, but I cannot go there. The visits are forbidden. It is a weird place. There was an accident there few years ago, so they control anyone who vants to visit the town. I bring the goods to local market weekly, using special pass from government.
