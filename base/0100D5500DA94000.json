    "description": "Shadow Blade is an action-platformer set in a visually striking world where the ancient teachings of ninjas and samurai clash upon a modern landscape. Sprint through stages littered with traps, slaying enemies along your path without hesitation as Kuro, the blade of shadow!\n\nStory\n\nDarkness and chaos are once again creeping into the world of man. The covenant made in a time almost forgotten has failed, the three clans now in a violent struggle for dominance. The medallion is almost made whole again and it falls upon Kuro?s shoulders to restore balance. All his training has led up to this one moment, where the fate of the world will rest in his blood-stained hands.\n\nKey Features\n\nEpic NINJA Platforming: Test your skills in fast-paced platforming, mastering the skills of the ninja to breeze through challenging levels. \n\nVicious NINJA Combat: Kill your enemies with extreme prejudice through the mastery of the katana, shurikens and kusarigama! \n\nShadow Ninja: Attack the guards before they see you and alert all other mobs.\n\nStory Campaign: Fully voiced motion comics tell the story of Kuro?s plight to restore balance!\n\nMore than 50 Challenging Levels: Environmental hazards, rifle-toting warriors and many more challenges await a hardened warrior.\n\nLevel Secrets: Raw speed doesn't guarantee the highest rank. A true ninja is ever vigilant, aware of any possibly hidden areas.\n\nNinja = Hardcore: Cleared the normal campaign? Prepare for the Hardcore variation and if you dare, the ultimate Master Class version awaiting only the foolhardy.",
