    "description": "Arkanoid is an iconic arcade game, developed by TAITO Corporation in 1986. When the mother ship ARKANOID comes under attack, the small spacecraft VAUS manages to escape but ends up warped into another dimension. Wandering in an inter-dimensional labyrinth, VAUS must destroy blocks called \"spacewalls\" in order to defeat \"DOH\", the creator of the maze responsible for ARKANOID’s destruction.\n\nArkanoid – Eternal Battle, developed by the talented French studio Pastagames marks the return of the iconic block breaker game.\n\nFor the first time ever, players will be able to compete against each other, offering an online experience thanks to the Eternal Battle mode, the main new feature of this game, brining the arcade experience to a whole new level.
