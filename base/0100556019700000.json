    "description": "Get to know the curious hobby of a kitten named Sissa! She’s a very organized feline, and when she plays with her balls of wool, each needs to be pushed across the floor to the correct spot. Presented in cute and colorful 3D style, Sissa’s Path is a pushing puzzle game where you play as Sissa and move her toys around tiled floors.\n\nOnce all the balls of wool rest on the white circular tiles, the stage is cleared, and another increasingly complex hand-crafted puzzle awaits to challenge Sissa’s toy-nudging skills. Can you help her organize her toys?\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Enjoy a relaxing  \"pushing puzzle\" experience!\n• Push balls of yarn onto target tiles to clear each brainteasing stage.\n• Navigate tricky maze-like levels in 3D isometric style!\n• Tackle progressively more difficult challenges and larger stages.\n• Retry as many times as it takes to find a solution!",
