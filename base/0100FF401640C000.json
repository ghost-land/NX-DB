    "description": "February, 1945. The war is almost over but your fight is about to begin. You play Gerda Larsen, a young nurse who is torn between her community and her desperate quest to save her husband, Anders. Many other lives will come to depend on your decisions. \nGerda’s journey will involve moral dilemmas, difficult conversations, and sticky situations. It’s a dangerous world and you must help her adapt to it with the choices you make, which always have both short- and long-term consequences. \n \nIf you give away precious resources to somebody who needs them now, will you come to regret it later? Will there be consequences if you, as a nurse, help a person who is suffering even though they may later cause suffering to others?  \n\nA STORY-DRIVEN RPG-LITE \nMake the most of what you have: your personality points, your allegiances, and your resources. Your relationship with people and factions will determine how your story unfolds. Level up Gerda’s mental skills by reflecting on her experiences in her diary to gain personality skill points. Use these skills during events and conversations to unlock special actions, gain others’ trust, or keep them from suspecting you. \n  \nMAKE YOUR OWN HISTORY \nYou can choose where to explore and when – but do so wisely, as people move around and events can be time sensitive. As you investigate and make progress, your choices will send you down many different narrative paths. Will you do whatever it takes to save Anders, or will you cling fiercely to your morals? Your actions will lead to several poignant conclusions and change the fate of your community in Gerda: A Flame in Winter. ",
