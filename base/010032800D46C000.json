    "description": "Have you ever wondered what would happen if a classic fantasy world was attacked by pulp science fiction monsters from outer space? Now you can find out! Dungeons & Aliens is an action game with space mutants, brave dwarves, and awesome magic. It combines swipe and slash mechanics (proven to be effective on both aliens and fruit) with Joy-Con™ steering and simple tower defence (as easy as placing vegetation to stop the undead). All this makes for a fun and colourful adventure!\n\nKey features:\n• Fresh mechanics: Swipe and slash meets tower defence\n• Hand-drawn, old-school storybook graphics\n• Upgradable spells for spectacular destruction\n• A comedic mashup of sci-fi and fantasy clichés\n• 60 challenging levels to beat and then master\n• Controls adapted for Nintendo Switch™\n",
