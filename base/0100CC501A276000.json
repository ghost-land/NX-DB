    "description": "Warp7 is an endless arcade space game where your only spaceship must warp seven times within seven minutes. You travel through seven weird regions of space towards the final warp gate where you pause to apply microchips (upgrades) to you spaceship.\n\nTick tock tick tock\nWith only seven minutes on the clock a balance must be struck between gathering extra microchips or progressing to the final warp and collecting the end bonus. When you die, all microchips gathered on that run are lost although you keep prior progress and might feel foolish. Warp7 is no rogue-lite - there is no permadeath.\n\nUpgrades with microchips\nWarp7 allows player choice in where your microchips are applied from the very first game. Do you direct every microchip into weapon damage, shields, or reducing weapon recharge? Or will you favour a balance progression opting for versatility across engine and shields and weapons? The cost of upgrades rises slightly the more you improve your ship but your new game starts with some free microchips. Microchips don't have to spent all at once.\n\nReady for action\nYour spaceship comes with a handy set of abilities (booster, emergency stop, phase shift and shield repair) that can be used repeatedly, after recharging. Your spaceship also has unlimited ammo including the devasting nova bomb. There is also an empty third slot in the weapons array for any weapons found on your journey.\n\nVanilla or something stronger\nSpace travel is unpredictable and so Warp7 offers a choice of three loadouts to your spaceship before every run - including an option that contains no extras and no defects - just the ship as is for spaceship pilots looking to enjoy the ride a bit more.",
