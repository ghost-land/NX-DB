Are they your allies... or enemies?\n\nWill you escape? Try to find out who you are? Why did the people who captured you steal your memoriesâ€”instead of just killing you? Travel the world as you uncover the details of a past that holds many secrets, and a future that is in peril.\n\nCHOICES THAT MATTER is a collection of epic text adventure games. Our interactive stories are some of the most complex in the this category. No one player can discover the entire story in a single play through!",
