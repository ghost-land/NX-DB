    "description": "The Fall of Elena Temple is an old-school puzzle platformer in which you explore rooms, avoid perils and collect all coins to progress. The catch is you can undo your falls! So don't be afraid of heights, fall and collect the coins bellow, then undo back up to where you fell from, keeping the coins!\n\nTest your forward thinking and logical skills. Plan your falls carefully, as your undos are limited. If you're not paying attention, you'll find yourself unable to restore back to the top, with coins still needing collecting!\n\nEnjoy the retro aesthetics with monochrome pixel art, playing the game on the state of the art handheld GrimBoy (TM) (wink). Reminisce about the good times with lovely pixel art backgrounds to put you right back into your childhood bedroom, the backyard, the park, grandma's living and many more.\n\nFEATURES:\n- 20 puzzle rooms to challenge your wits\n- 3 bonus rooms with new mechanics unlocked after you finish the game\n- Grab the undo crystal to enable going back up to five previous positions before falling\n- Collect all coins in a dungeon room to open the passage to the next one\n- Navigate through teleporters, locked doors, spikes, flying - arrows, snakes, crumbling platforms and many more perils\n- Crack a smile at Elena's musings!",
