Get to know your new AI best friend inside and out via the DREAMSCAPE terminal interface, as they help you through this simulation.\n\n\n[CAUTION]\nNote that a DREAMSCAPE is a reflection of an AI's mental state, and that exploring the mind of a contaminated AI could yield unpredictable results.\nHowever, there is no need to worry. as this recruitment exercise is only a simulation of what a real DREAMSCAPE would look like.\n\n\n[DESCRIPTION]\nTHE ENIGMA MACHINE is a first-person sci-fi horror puzzle game that aims to capture the obscurity and unpredictability of games of old, framed within an increasingly unsettling presentation.\n\nFeatures:\n• A unique fusion of glitchy mid-90's 3D graphics and VHS effects with more modern graphical effects for a distinctive visual style.\n• A series of puzzles which force you to think outside the box.\n• A blend of traditional first-person controls combined with point-and-click mechanics for satisfying interaction with the world.\n• A story that could only be told through the medium of games\n",
