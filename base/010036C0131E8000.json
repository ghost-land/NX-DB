This is my choice.\n\ndivided into five chapters,which respectively include dawn, dusk, night, starry sky and the valley.\n\nEach chapter corresponds to the runes in different functions-forest, lights, sleepness, gravity and the scales.\n\nDawn,ordinary path, placed the passing through;\nDusk,realities and the illusions, triggering the switching;\nNight,the bondage of the bubbles, breaking up the movement;\nStarry sky,Up and down or left and right, the gravity changes;\nThe valley,the weight from the environment, make it sink or float from left to right.\n\nPlayers need to use runes with different functions to collect the crystals that represent the courage and create a way lead to the future.\n\nMoreover, the players who want to show their amazing creativity can design the level belonging to themselves, upload it to the creative space and embarrass others (or make them laughs)!\n\nAs long as the designed level can finally lead to the destination, you will have the naming rights of the check point which will let all players see your work!",
