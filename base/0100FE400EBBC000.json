Feeding the monkeys is strictly prohibited.\nSHIT HITTING THE FAN: What may (or may not) happen if you feed the monkeys.\n\nOddly enough, club members keep feeding the monkeys as though they just can’t abide by this very simple rule! How about you? Will you help those you’re spying on, extort them, expose them and sabotage their dreams, or will you follow your instructions and sit twiddling your thumbs while the world burns?",
