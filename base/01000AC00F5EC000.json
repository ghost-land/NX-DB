Welcome to the Stitched-Together Planet! \nBoth populations agreed on one condition that should never be broken: nobody can cross the border that separates them. But what exactly happens if someone breaks the rule? Thatâ€™s what you will find out!\n\nRun, jump, fight, avoid traps, collect coins and beat bosses in this fun and family-friendly platformer adventure. In each of the 5 worlds you will discover new challenges and enemies and evolve in unique and fantastic sceneries.\n\nWhat exactly can you expect with Spirit Roots:\n- Wonders and variety. 50 levels in 5 worlds with their own atmospheres, enemies, mechanics and music;\n- Platformer gameplay. Run, jump, collect items and fight mean creatures on the way;\n- Epic boss battles. Farmer robots? Huge spiders? Flying skulls? Mud monsters? We've packed it all into our game!\n",
