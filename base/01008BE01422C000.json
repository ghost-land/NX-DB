You must develop and improve features while increasing hosting capacity and run marketing campaigns.\n\nThe city offers you offices in all sizes and shapes. It’s up to you to select the most suitable. It’s your job to organize and decorate the office while keeping your employees happy.\n\nYour employees are a vital part of your success. As you grow, you must continue recruiting more people. Over time, your employees will start demanding more of you and the company. It’s your job to keep them happy, before your competitors send them a job offer they can’t reject!\n\nThere’s no website without stable and reliable servers.

It’s up to you if you want to buy and merge your competitors or outrun them until they go out of business!\n\nFeatures:\n- Running a website\n- Setting up offices\n- Managing employees\n- Configuring servers",
