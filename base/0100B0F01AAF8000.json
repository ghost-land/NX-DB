    "description": "Introducing Mighty Mage, the top-down arena shooter rogue-lite where you play as a cute mage on a journey to become a master magician. Armed with up to 5 elemental spells at a time, you'll take on hordes of enemies and choose from a variety of upgrades and spells to create unique builds.\n\nIn Mighty Mage, every wave presents a new challenge that you must overcome by choosing an upgrade or skill before taking on the enemies. From slow but tough Slimes to fast but weak Bats, you'll face a variety of foes on your journey to become the ultimate mage.\n\nThe game features a pixelated and clean design, with cute characters, vibrate colors and a lot of velocity and fun. With two mechanics of dashing and shooting, you'll need to make strategic decisions on when to use each to defeat your enemies. When shooting, you'll walk slowly and cannot dash to avoid enemies, but when dashing, you'll become invulnerable for a short period and receive an impulse in the input direction.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you'll choose from a variety of upgrades to buff your stats or restore your health, as well as learn new magic to become a better mage. Every upgrade and move has its own description, so you can customize your playstyle and make Mighty Mage truly your own.\n\nDon't miss out on the chance to become the Mighty Mage and take on the tower challenges to become the ultimate master magician!",
