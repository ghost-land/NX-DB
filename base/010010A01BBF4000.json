    "description": "The Forest Quartet is a 3D narrative puzzler about a gone, but not forgotten, lead singer. Play her spirit and travel through 3 acts unique to the members of her band for a final farewell concert. Face their emotions, solve puzzles and fight the corruption plaguing their souls.\n\n• ABOUT •\n\nKIRK\nSomething strange has taken over the once green and lush nature that Kirk would draw his inspiration from. The fungus slowly creeps and turns growth into decay. Use the power of your voice to restore the forest.\n\nJB\nThe forest has become an abyss of darkness.\nCreatures have awoken from the depths of the underground, swarming JB's house.\nFind the light that once existed to reignite JB's musical spark.\n\nSEBASTIAN\nA volcano has erupted, spitting lava out into the nearby forest causing fires and destruction. Reestablish a system of water in the deep underground and reconnect lost pipes to stop the volcanic eruption.\n\n• FEATURES •\n\nSPIRIT POWER\nSing to interact with objects, create light with your fingertips. Glide, float, and transform into butterflies to explore the band members' psyches.\n\nLISTEN CLOSELY\nEnvironments and objects add unique layers to the soundtrack. Whether it be crackling forest fires or the cold winds from the deep caverns.\n\nA STORY OF LIFE\nLive through heartbreak and loss. Recover from grief and restore the band’s musical spark.\n\nA RELAXING GAMEPLAY\nNo written descriptions or instructions, progressively gain powers for your travels.\n\nNote from the developer:\nThe Forest Quartet is a personal and family made project.
