    "description": "5 cars are available to get you to the final fort, each capable of holding progressively more loot. Ranging from the simple Redneck pick-up and the classy Hunter and to the tough Sledge and frankly-silly Harvester, you’ll enjoy throwing these bodged-up jalopies at the lines of the undead. Each is highly customisable, with 15 upgrades including spiked bumpers, improved tyres, buffed engines, and more ammo, fuel and nitros. With 8 locations to traverse, handsome 3D graphics and gory shambling bodies, Zombie Derby is a killer game.\n\nKey features\n\n• 5 killer cars to drive\n• 5 levels to explore\n• 3 extreme levels\n• Massively customisable vehicles\n\nDrive to survive!",
