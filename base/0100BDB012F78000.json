    "description": "Street fights have never been funnier! Drunken Fist is a physics-based brawler that never takes itself too seriously. Take the role of a drunk guy as he looks for food and collects booze across 7 challenging stages. Along the way, you’ll cross paths with jocks, hipsters, punks and a motley bunch of other enemy types, each with their own unique combat styles.\n\nHilariously simulating the feel of a drunken fight in dynamic 3D physics, the blows fly past, you constantly fall down and behave ridiculously. Will our inebriated hero ever get home?\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Enjoy a colorfully minimalist polygon art style.\n• Laugh at unpredictable antics generated by dynamic 3D physics.\n• Battle across 7 unique levels with a variety of opponents!\n• Collect food items and bottles of booze.\n• Urinate on the asphalt or even on enemies!",
