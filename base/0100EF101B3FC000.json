    "description": "The rules of the game are simple - you need to pull the pin and fill the glass with colored balls!\n\nBut the further you go, the harder the puzzles become. You have to color the gray balloons before filling the glass with them, otherwise you will lose. To color the gray balls, you need to combine them with colored ones, and only then you can fill the glass with them.\n\nWith each level, the number of compartments and obstacles increases, so you need to come up with a strategy - in what order to paint the balls. One wrong move and you will drop the gray balls into the glass!\n\nGAME FEATURES:\n• Excellent workout for the mind and logic;\n• Many levels of varying difficulty;\n• Simple and minimalistic graphics;\n• Management with the Joy-Con™️ controllers;\n• Relaxing musical accompaniment;",
