    "description": "The screen looks 3D! I can see it!\nDo you have \"stereoscopic vision\"?\nThe way to do it is to look at your hand as if you were looking at the distance.\nIf you are not sure, ask a nearby teacher or adult.\n\nWhen you start the game, the stereoscopic view begins.\nPlease move to the right while avoiding obstacles.\nThe stages are endless and the difficulty level increases little by little.\n\nIt is fun even if the game is over.\nYou will be able to continue the game by pressing the \"A\" button.\n\n*But please be careful not to overdo the game.\nStop after listening to one song of the game music, for example.\nLet's play for 5 minutes only...\nIn between other games.\nPlease set your own rules and enjoy the game.\n\nBGM : MaouDamashii",
