    "description": "Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of Central Japan lies Ludens Castle, where five friends, the Retro Revengers, get isekai'd into a strange land that threatens the existence of not just their games, but their world too.\n\nEmbark on a journey with Ossan, Mao, Taicho, Matchan and Notchi as you harness their newfound abilities bestowed upon them by the Retro Goddess. Meet companions from the past, defend yourself from enemies, and overcome the bosses blocking your way to the Demon Overlord of Triple-A. \n\nExplore diverse stage environments and different powers with each companion, all in beautiful 16-bit pixel art and accompanied by retro music. Master the characters' different powers as you traverse diverse environments full of unforgiving enemies in this retro-style platformer.\n\nWith the stages and their mechanics changing as you progress through the game, switch between the characters to find the fastest way through each level. The upbeat music and a narrative bursting with references and Easter eggs will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very end!\n\n",
