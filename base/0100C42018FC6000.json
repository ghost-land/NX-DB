You will have to use that meager income to buy upgrades, equipment, and hire coworkers.\n\nThe enemies only grow stronger by each passing day, and you never know when they might eventually overpower you.\n\nEvery morning, you can buy one card out of three choices. There are over 70 cards, including weapons, coworkers, upgrades, and random chance events.
