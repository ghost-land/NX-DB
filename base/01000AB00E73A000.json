Choose from 4 different characters, each with their own unique abilities! Can you bring peace to the cosmos?\n \n• Story mode introduces the Cosmic Defenders as they fight against a group of aliens that want to steal the Tree of Life, a sacred tree that maintains the balance in the universe. Advance through levels over 4 galaxies, each with unique challenges and ways to play! \n• Survival mode lets you enjoy new levels every time they play! Collect coins to purchase outfits with skill buffs!\n• Versus mode lets you compete against your friends, rather than aliens, because Defenders need to train too!",
