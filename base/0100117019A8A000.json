    "description": "Every turn each player scores points by placing a triangular tile anywhere on the grid to match one of three colours and shapes.\n\nPlayers balance optimal scoring and tactical tile placement - what might seem a good scoring tile now could be bad later if it allows your opponent better scoring potential.\n\nThe game ends when the board is full and a winner is usually declared (a draw is possible if both players are evenly matched).\n\nTriangulate features full controller support as well as on-demand colour changes with colour-blind palettes already present (plus some regular garish colour palettes).",
