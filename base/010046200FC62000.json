    "description": "Bigger and badder than ever before, Kingdom Rush: Frontiers is a whole new level of the furiously fast, enchantingly charming gameplay that made the original title an award-winning hit. Tap your troops through an epic (mis)adventure as you defend exotic lands from dragons, man-eating plants, and ghastly denizens of the underworld -all with flashy new towers, levels, heroes, and more goodies to help you crush your foes to a pulp. (Don't worry, we've still got all the good ol' stuff from the last game, too. It's vintage now.) \nKingdom Rush: Frontiers packs in so much content, it's like a fully upgraded artillery blast of mouthwatering, pixelated joy launched right into your smiling little face... and it hurts so good! \n\nGAME FEATURES \n\n- Over 60 enemies with unique abilities! Stay on your toes as you fight through desert sandworms, tribal shamans, nomad tribes and underground terrors.\n\n- 16 legendary heroes. Choose your champions and train their abilities! Each has unique specialties that fit different play styles!\n\n- Hours of gameplay with over 80 achievements!\n\n- Three difficulty modes! Are you up for a real challenge? Go with Veteran mode!\n\n- Intoxicating charm with a rousing score, full-bodied voice-overs and lovingly illustrated cartoon art!",
