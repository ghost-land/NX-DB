Move blocks and go to the portal! The rule is simple but the puzzle isn’t. Because it’s a puzzle in 3D, you can rotate your point of view and see how to move!\n\nKey feature:\n\n    COOPERATE WITH OR WITHOUT: Minimal Move is playable in solo or in cooperative mode. We highly recommend playing with two!\n\n    BE A PART OF AN ADVENTUROUS STORY!: Minimal Move is a story driven puzzle game that takes place in a wonder science fiction world.\n\n    EXPLORE DIFFERENT WORLD! : Each world will have different types of blocks for playing the puzzle in new ways.\n\n    MEET FUN AND DANGEROUS CHARACTERS! : In addition to the main characters Kaiten and Ido, there will be funny but maybe dangerous monsters and robots coming your way!\n\n    SMASH EACH OTHER: Ido and Kaiten can smash each other!
