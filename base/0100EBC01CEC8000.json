    "description": "Welcome to Bullet Rodeo, a 2D, bullet hell game where bandits rob banks and terrorize towns. Do you have what it takes to become a vigilante and bring back order in this quiet place? \n\n\nIT’S THE WILD WEST!\nDefeat opponents in the town, on the train, and in the wild. Watch out not to shoot innocent citizens, and look up to the sky for wild eagles. You can’t trust anyone, except your best friend - revolver. Get through all 3 stages and try to beat your previous score with every try. But be careful, if you die at any stage you will have to start all over again from the beginning. \n\n\nBECOME A MASTER\nShoot enemies as soon as you see them but remember your gun can only fire 6 bullets before you have to reload. Survive duels by dodging, crouching, or even hiding behind covers. And if you are low on health, look for the eagles that carry extra HP points for you. If your enemies start escaping by train, simply get on your horse and catch them!\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n- Many types of enemies\n- Unique locations straight from the wild-west\n- 3 stages to challange\n- Soundtrack that will help you get into the role of sheriff\n- Different mechanics for attack and defense\n- Scoreboard which shows your attempts",
