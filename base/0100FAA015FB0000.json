    "description": "Troupe is a 2D platform adventure game, and takes the classic formula in which the player controls a clown and tries to get out of a haunted castle.\n\nConceived as an exploration-driven game (metroidvania), the player initially wandered around the castle alone, and later, gained a whole troupe of companions. In addition to just wanting to leave the castle, the player now aims to rescue his co-workers.\n\nDespite the inspiration in 2D platform games, the player is not limited to linear pathways or where to start the game, having complete freedom to decide which order to take and rescue his team, gaining new abilities as the game progresses.\n\nThe game's art, music and plot are inspired by circus culture and medieval fantasy aesthetics. Come and discover the journey of this clown who is fated to battle this way to save his colleagues and in the process discover truths about himself.\n\nTroupe is set in a fictional medieval universe and a cast of five characters, each with their own story, goals and abilities. And the castle where the entire game takes place is divided into three sections, each with specific characteristics and challenges.",
