A terrifying sparrow attacks him and tears off several parts of his spaceship. After this incident, Spinny takes his emergency propellers and goes to find the lost parts of his spaceship in order to rebuild it.\n\nHelp Spinny to find his way through mazes, dodge traps and fix his spaceship to get back home.\n\nSpinny's Journey is a challenging 2D action-puzzle game. You'll fly with his emergency propeller and search for the pieces to repair his spaceship.\n\nThe game will challenge your skills and resilience with its simple-to-learn and hard-to-master gameplay.",
