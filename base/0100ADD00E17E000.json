    "description": "Players will use their own two hands and the outstretched grip of their friends to grapple across each level on their way to victory. Grab one anotherâ€™s hands, climb across dangling bodies, and swing your pals to safety in a wobbly, dangly mass of limbs. Customize your character with all manner of stylish accessories and zany accouterment in a vain attempt to remember who you are and which of your hands is the only thing between you and the plummet of doom.",
