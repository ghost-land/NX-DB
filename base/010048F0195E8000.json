In response, humanity launched a strike on the Strogg homeworld...it failed, but you survived. Outnumbered and outgunned, fight your way through fortified military installations and shut down the enemy's war machine. Only then will the fate of humanity be known. \n\nGet Both of the Original Mission Packs \n\nQuake II includes both original mission packs: “The Reckoning,” featuring 18 campaign levels and 7 deathmatch maps, and “Ground Zero,” featuring 15 campaign levels and 14 deathmatch maps. \n\nMission Pack: The Reckoning \n\nIn the first official expansion pack for Quake II, you are part of an elite commando force that must infiltrate a Strogg site. Once inside, you must scour industrial landscapes, crawl through waterways and air ducts, navigate treacherous canyons teeming with vicious mutants, stow away on an alien spacecraft, and destroy the enemy's secret moon base. \n\nMission Pack: Ground Zero \n\nIn the second official expansion pack for Quake II, you, and a few marines are the lucky ones. You've made it to the surface of Stroggos in one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational. With the fleet trapped around Stroggos, only 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades and destroy the Gravity Well. \n\nPlay the All-New “Call of the Machine” Expansion \n\nA brand-new Quake II experience from MachineGames consisting of 28 campaign levels and one multiplayer deathmatch map. In the depths of Strogg space lies the Machine, a singularity capable of collapsing the fabric of reality.

Bot support for offline and online DM and TDM modes included. \n\nPlay Together with Crossplay \n\nPlay the campaign and all expansion packs cooperatively or go toe-to-toe in multiplayer matches with your friends regardless of platform!\n\nMotion Aiming Ready\n\nImprove your gunplay with an option that allows you to aim using gyro controls.
