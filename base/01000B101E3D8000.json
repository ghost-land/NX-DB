    "description": "Builder Simulator is a game for those, whose biggest dream always was to construct your own house from scratch. Prepare your plan, buy needed materials, and build a perfect residence brick by brick. Will it be an easy task? At first, yes! After all, you’re just a rookie in this serious building industry. A specially made tutorial will guide you step by step through the twists and turns of construction work. However, the more experience you get, the more demanding the challenges become.\n\nBUILD\n\nHave you finished your little design? Good! Now it’s time to put it into practice. Grab a bunch of bricks, take some cement, roll up your sleeves, and build, construct, and create! Are you afraid it’ll be boring? No, no, no. Nothing like that! You’ll dig the foundation, erect walls, insert windows or doors, and many more. It will not only be exciting, but above all, it will be fun!\n\nFINISH\n\nYou’re very proud of those straight walls and perfect roof… but it’s not over! It’s time to finish this pretty, little house. How? Of course, by polishing its exterior! It’s like putting makeup on a perfectly sculpted face. You can finish the elevation, do the floor or paint walls. Do everything you can to make this house splendid!\n\nDESIGN\n\nEvery big construction project starts with a pencil and a piece of paper. And so, it is in the Builder Simulator. You’ll start your work by designing a house on a drawing board. Lines, curves, squares – the whole layout is up to your taste.  The only thing that can hold you back is your own imagination. So use this head of yours and draw the most excellent building of it all! And if you don't have an idea for a design, you can always choose one of the projects we have prepared.\n\nSHARE\n\nLeaving this creation to rot on your computer would be such a waste, right? That’s why we prepare something special for all our precious players – the Community Builder! This is a place where you can share your projects. You can also build a house based on someone else’s project. Show your creations, admire the works of people from all over the world and meet other building freaks! Just share your passion and most importantly…\n\n…HAVE FUN!",
