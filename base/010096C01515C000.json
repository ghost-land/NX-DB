You decide to take action and leave this place.\n\nCollect stars on your way - they serve as fuel. Be agile, think on the fly, or plan your route through challenging levels. Open doors, use pipes to travel from one place to the other. Make use of speed boosts and dodge rockets doing barrel rolls!",
