Each map presents its own set of challenges, from icy patches and frozen lakes to sand dunes and rock formations. You can choose to play in either hard or easy mode, depending on your skill level.\nIn the capture zone game mode, you’ll need to drive to specific locations on the map while avoiding the police. The police will be hot on your tail, and you’ll need to use your driving skills to outmaneuver them and reach your destination. In the delivery money mode, you’ll need to transport valuable cargo across the map while avoiding obstacles and police pursuit.\nAs you complete objectives, you’ll earn money that you can use to unlock new cars and upgrades.
