    "description": "Feral Flowers is a lightning-fast romp through 92 levels of botanical platforming mayhem.\n\nPlaying as Quigley the Gardener, you'll battle hordes of pollen-spewing flowers. Owing to his rather unfortunate pollen allergy, you'll need to battle against the clock to beat them before the air gets too dense and you sneeze yourself all the way back to the first stage.
