The Master will need you to be strong during these troubling times.\n\n●\tFixed camera angles to escalate the dread- you never know what you’ll find waiting just around the corner…\n●\tNostalgic graphics, with thematic and mechanical nods to classic survival horror games.\n●\tEldritch secrets lurk in the bowels of this house…drag them into the light.\n●\tPut together the pieces of a haunting story by collecting letters from the past, unraveling the mystery of the mansion and its dark history.\n\nRemember: Good girls take their medicine. Good girls do their chores. Good girls go home.",
