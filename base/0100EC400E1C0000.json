    "description": "The rules are simple.\nSlide the Mahjong tiles divided into the upper, middle and lower parts to the left and right, and connect the ridges vertically and horizontally.\nChoose the connected pots and add them to your hand, make a role and earn points.\n\n[Play tips]\nVarious roles are combined like real mahjong. Let's aim high score while thinking carefully.\n\nLeave a useful bag, you can aim at the role of high difficulty by getting it together later.\n\nIf it is difficult to see the roses, sort them by type and make them easy to see.\n\nThe upper row and the lower row are separated, so there is no connection.\nUse the middle stage well, let's drop the upper stage, and let the chopsticks connect.\n\nThe bonus is increased each time the number of twins increases.\nThe score will increase enormously by accumulating even a small role.\n\n【Ranking mode】\nCompete with users across the country for unlimited time to jams.\nThe ranking is reset weekly.\n\n\nKeep on hitting the ultimate mahjong who will not be disturbed by real opponents or game computers.",
