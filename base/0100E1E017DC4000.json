    "description": "Virgo Versus The Zodiac is a sci-fi/fantasy JRPG with a focus on memorable characters and unique combat mechanics in which you play as an obsessed villain.\n\nThe game features traditional turn-based combat with real-time execution of moves: blocking, countering and timing your attacks carefully as well as predicting your foes' moves is essential to succeed in your cosmic quest.\n\nIn this galaxy where every action means a reaction, you’ll play as Virgo, the Holy Queen (often called Dreadful Queen by heretics). Guide Virgo as she embarks upon a twisted and unforgiving cosmic quest to bring back the Golden Age, a period of peace, symmetry and balance–or so she thinks. Bring mayhem to the Zodiac Realms and leave a trail of stardust on your way, all to help others conform to Virgo’s excessively righteous worldview and see the light.\n\nKEY FEATURES:\nA unique turn based combat system featuring timed-actions and counterattacks.\nNo random encounters: every fight is a unique challenge designed specifically for the player.\nA focus on exploration and discovery, with multiple endings.\nZodiac Memories: peer behind the veil to explore the backstories of the Zodiacs!\nBoss Rush Mode: face off against all of the game’s bosses in a gauntlet that will test your mastery and combat abilities.  \nTake the dangerous route and fight off the Space Reptiles in an optional Action Filled Shoot’em Up Minigame!\nAnd, above all: riding alpacas!",
