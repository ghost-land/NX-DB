As the game progresses and you learn new rules and mechanics, you’ll have to maneuver multiple molecules simultaneously on the same screen, staying on your toes and consistently reconsidering the space around you as the challenge level ratchets up.

Immerse yourself in this delightful, mechanically intuitive, and elegant experience while getting lost in the art of rewarding puzzle solving.\n\n• The minimalist mashup sequel to award-winning puzzle games Sokobond and Cosmic Express\n• Ambient and relaxing soundtrack to provide zen-vibes while puzzle solving\n• Created by up-and-coming puzzle designer Jose Hernandez, and published by renowned puzzle experts Draknek & Friends (A Monster's Expedition, Bonfire Peaks)",
