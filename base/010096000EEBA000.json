    "description": "Hanwell, once a safe haven from the horrors of the world, now a cesspit of anomalous scum. Explore a dense open world of terror, every building a unique location with its own story to tell.\n\nUsing efficient, state of the art compression techniques we've managed to squeeze Welcome to Hanwell into a tiny 3GB install for Nintendo Switch with no perceivable loss in visual quality!\n\nThere is something deeply unsettling about Hanwell. Unexplained noises, something in the corner of your eye or laying just beyond the shadows create an atmosphere that will keep you constantly on edge.\n\nMonsters roam the streets. They occasionally get into the once protected buildings. What you do with them is up to you, be resourceful and pick up whatever you can find in order to fight them. Or run. And don't look back.\n\nThere is an entire city to explore, featuring different environments each more distinct than the last. From residential homes, old English pubs, parks, stores, supermarkets and government buildings, all the way to the infamous HCPP research center. Each location holds its own backstory, leading to your arrival.\n\nJump in, turn out the lights and discover the terrifying world of Hanwell.",
