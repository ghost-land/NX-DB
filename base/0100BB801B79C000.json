Unravel the mysteries of Eternity and shape your fate in a mesmerising adventure like no other!\n\nLook and Feel\nThe game employs a unique hand-crafted art style, making use of line art, animation and a striking two-tone palette.

Find the pieces you'll need by exploring, solving challenges, and trading with other ghosts.\n\nRelax\nA twin-stick game like no other, Hauntii combines classic shooting action with a slower, more contemplative pace as you traverse the otherworldly landscapes of Eternity - all set to a richly textured soundtrack by LightReturn",
