Each beer you collect will add to your overall score, but it will also make the screen more blurry, making it harder to see what's coming up ahead.\n\nThe game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, each with its own unique challenges and enemies. \n\nSo, put on your drinking hat and get ready for an adventure in this funny 2D pixel platformer!",
