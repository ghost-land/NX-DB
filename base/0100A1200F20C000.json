    "description": "It's late at night, and you've discovered a mysterious book that seems to have its own evil agenda. As you begin to read through it, you realize that you are not alone – the monsters are coming. The only way to free yourself from this fiendish nightmare is to keep reading… and finish the book.\n\nMidnight Evil is a story-driven first-person horror game where you play William Crinkle, a child who is being attacked by goblin-like creatures known as Urklings – beasts with a taste for the flesh of children. Spotting the monsters in time will banish them for a while, but they can only be defeated by reading the text within the book that binds them.\nCan you survive the night?\n\nFeatures:\n-\tA spooky narrative about ancient beings!\n-\tFully voice acted!\n-\tUnlockable minigames\n-\tA charming and cheesy 80's horror environment with comedic relief!\n-\tA familiar sit-and-survive playstyle!",
