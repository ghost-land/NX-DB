    "description": "You play as a rainbow-wielding cat on a mission to spread brightly coloured joy by removing bumble bees, off-beat music, and other unpleasant things. Your rainbows protect you from the bad things that can kill you and also provide you with platforms to walk and jump on.\n\nCat on a rainbow\nChasing you is the misery ghost who lurks near you at the start of every level. Initially stunned for several seconds the misery ghost wants to keep everything dull, grey and joyless. Spend too long shooting rainbows and jumping on rainbows and the ghost hunts you with increasing ferocity.\n\nMysterache is your magical feline friend\nAt the top of every level the Persian cat Mysterache is there to greet you. In his palace he offers you a random choice of three powerful permanent rewards to aid you on your rainbow mission. Touching his face removes all remaining enemies in play with his magic words and vanquishes the misery ghost.\n\nGems and goodies\nTo help you there are items to collect that appear when an enemy dies. Collect 7 gems of each rainbow colour and Mysterache automatically grants you another run at a level if you die - very handy since you only start with one life! Collect a powerup and enjoy a temporary freeze of time or witness the power of giant rainbows!\n\nRainbows — lots of rainbows\n• brightly coloured environment\n• lots of rainbows\n• rainbows and more rainbows\n• raaaaaaaainboooooooows!\n• rainbows rainbows rainbows\n\nPowerful rewards\n• Choose one from three\n• Available from Mysterache's palace\n• Always available on standard levels\n• Include magic potions, fairy items, and more\n\n???
