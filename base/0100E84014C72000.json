    "description": "Hi,\n\nI hope this email finds you well. I’ve received the cd you had sent me and after a cursory glance at the files, I have to say the chances of recovering the software seem promising. There seems to be some data corruption but it’s quite possible it may still run.\n\nNow, again, I haven’t really dug too deep into it but it appears that it’s some sort of a simple game. I’ve seen plenty of things labelled as “map” so it probably has many levels. Pretty sure it involves some sort of a gun also? My guess is, it’s most likely one of those retro shooters.\n\nAnyway, gonna go take a nap. Couldn’t really get much sleep last night; had a lot of nightmares, can’t quite remember about what. I’ll keep you updated on my progress.\n\nSincere regards,\nDavid",
