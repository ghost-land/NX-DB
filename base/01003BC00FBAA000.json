    "description": "Colour Jumper is an abstract, colour-based puzzle-platformer focused on fast and precise movement, with incredibly tight and responsive controls.\n\nYou control a block with a different colour on each of its four sides. Certain platforms, enemy patrols, and other level elements can only be interacted with using your block's matching side.\n\nWith every jump, your block rotates 90 degrees, so each leap must be planned carefully.\n\nSome levels are methodical puzzles boxes, others demand lightning-quick reflexes, but they'll all send you on a tumbling high-speed parkour path to the exit!\n\nFeatures:\n- Elegant, minimalist level design.\n- Instant respawns (you're welcome).\n- Four mind-boggling boss fights.\n- Dedicated speedrun mode!\n- Collectibles that unlock extra-challenging bonus levels.\n- Time and rotation goals: a completionist's dream!\n- Ghost mode: race yourself!\n- Colourblind mode!",
