    "description": "Charge head first into… spikes! Then use your handy energy bullet to boost through obstacles and live to solve more puzzles in this 2D puzzle-platformer of deliberate charging!\n\nCharge Kid is a game where each jump is a puzzle. You have to find clever uses of the mechanics and physics to \"solve\" each location by reaching the desired location. You have limited resources to make each jump. The game focuses on the puzzle aspect instead of precision-platforming. The hard part is figuring out how to use your resources to make each jump instead of the execution. But don't get fooled! The execution is also hard, which means finding each solution is even harder!\n\nFeatures:\n- Tight controls and fluid movement,\n- Challenging gameplay,\n- Puzzles with multiple solutions,\n- Cute and minimalistic pixel art,\n- Slick sound effects and music!",
