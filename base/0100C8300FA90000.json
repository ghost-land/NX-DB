    "description": "In Save Koch you play mafia Godfather, who is basically besieged inside his own panic room. Danger-danger! Someone in the Сity decided to take your place, and there is a sleeper “mole” inside your Family, who is acting as we speak. Time is running out, you have only six days to solve the plot, resolve who is standing behind this conspiracy, resolve the problem and send the challenger to feed the fish.\n\nEach new game session of Save Koch is played in a completely different manner. At the start, the game shuffles the NPCs deck, which leads to all game events and, subsequently, your methods will be completely unique to that particular game session. It’s as if you were playing your favorite desktop game with a bunch of friends — you’ve just beat the game, but the fun only begins! Make strategic decisions, join unexpected alliances, hire detectives, bribe or even torture witnesses, if your tastes up to; do everything to find that criminal mastermind who challenges you. And also flush out that hiding mole. And also not become a victim.\n\nEach decision has consequences: for the residents of the city of New Kandinski, for your thugs, Family, and, in fact, for you. At stake is life.",
