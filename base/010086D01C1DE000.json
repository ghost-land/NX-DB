Play as Alina, a formidable female gladiator who must engage in relentless combat in front of a bloodthirsty crowd to survive, round by round. With roguelike deckbuilding and hex-based tactics, players are no longer bound by simple attack and defense. Make use of dodges, knockbacks and anything you can to stay alive!\n\nDynamic Deckbuilding\nPick up dozens of cards, keep the ones you need, and craft a unique deck as you fight your way through randomized levels that present a different challenge each run!\n\nHex-based Tactics\nUnlike traditional deck builders that focus on attack and defense, the tactics element adds a dimension of positioning. Dupe your enemies into attacking each other, or use the terrain to gain an upper hand.\n\nDual Equipment System\nCarry equipment in both hands to enhance your cards! You can dual wield daggers for extra damage, go with a sword and shield combo for rounded performance, or wreak havoc with a two-handed weapon. Figure out the best combination for each fight!",
