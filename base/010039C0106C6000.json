    "description": "In the world of Baron, the Great War rages on. Aircraft are new, exciting machines that defy gravity! Those who fly them -- those brave animals -- are daring, flamboyant, and impossibly glamorous.\n\nChoose your creature, and take to the sky in your trusty biplane to join intense battles against other pilots.\n\nUp to 8 players can battle either all-on-all or in teams.\n\nArm your aircraft to the teeth with wonderful wacky weapons that include Giant Anvils, Freeze Rays, or the ever-popular Banana Peel!\n\nFlying is easy to learn. (Even non-gamers will be flying in no time.) But under the hood, the aerodynamics have a depth that will take months to master.\n\n4 unique aircraft, with different flight characteristics and abilities.\n\n8 heroic characters- each with their own taunts, insignia and victory song.\n\n13 Special Weapons will keep you busy discovering new ways to destroy your opponents.\n\nSingle-player game modes include Battle (teams or all-on-all), Training, and a woolly Sheep Attack.\n\nSo pull on your goggles, strap in, and prepare for takeoff. Fur is gonna fly!\n",
