And this better not be a zombie! Use obstacles, light \ndeclines and hazards cleverly and disorient the zombies. This is how you reach the saving elevator.\n\n• Satisfying gameplay thanks to four different worlds and a total of 120 levels\n• Horrible zombies – flee from Burping Bob, Roaming Ray and Ripley or Lifting Louis!\n• A new challenge in every level\n• The zombie apocalypse has never been this funny: ingenious comic-style for adults and children",
