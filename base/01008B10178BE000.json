    "description": "Challenge your cue ball shooting skills in Cyber Pool, an arcade neon-filled recreation of the famous billiards game. Smash your cue ball on brightly colored balls across 40 unique tables that start from vanilla and get crazier as you go. This love letter to the classic arcade games is easy to learn yet hard to master, challenging you at every turn across 6 different modes.\n\nEnjoy a blast from the past in Classic mode, where you only have three strokes to pocket all the balls and claim victory. If that’s laying the pressure on thick, you can practice and chill in Arcade mode with unlimited strokes. When you’re ready to seriously test your mettle, dive into Challenge mode and see if you can pocket the balls in order. You can also have your friends join in the fun. Team up together to clear all levels in Cooperation mode or go head-to-head in the game’s competitive Race and Battle modes.\n\nFeatures:\n- 40 unique tables with stunning visuals\n- 6 different modes\n- Incredible attention to detail",
