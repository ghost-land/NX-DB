    "description": "Shipped is an adorable party game where up to 8 players compete in sea skirmishes. Choose your favorite girl and navigate the sea. Your ship can’t break, so first learn how to maneuver. With simple controls, it’s easy to start but hard to master.\n\nTo win, you must push your opponents to crash on land or out of the screen. Or just shoot them. To do that, grab ammo crates. If you’re out of cannonballs, use your cannon and blow air to push enemies or deflect incoming fire. Remember to keep up with the movement of the camera - if your ship goes off-screen, it will instantly explode!\n\nWith five different modes, you’ll never get bored playing Shipped. If you’re short on friends to play, you can always add AI-controlled players or try the challenging single-player arcade mode. \n\nFeatures: \n\nLocal multiplayer for 2-8 players.\nArcade single-player mode or AI-controlled players for solo play.\nFive different game modes: Cruise, Chase, Race, Yincana, Sumo.\nFun and straightforward mechanics. \nLovely characters, colorful graphics, and a pleasant soundtrack. \nOver 95% positive reviews from PC players!\n",
