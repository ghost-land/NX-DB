    "description": "The only thing worse than entering a bullet hell shootout in deep space is not having the ability to shoot back, right? In Shuttlecock-H, that’s all part of the fun! Pilot your unarmed shuttle with absolute accuracy, and the 3 female companions you encounter will be sure to make it worth your trouble.\n\nShuttlecock-H is a naughty “dodge’em up” bullet hell game where you’ll need to evade enemies and projectiles while collecting hearts, up to 30 in each stage.

Each girl selected offers a different take on the story and a variety of increasingly spicy scenes to unlock, all voiced in Japanese!\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Dodge enemies and projectiles to clear each bullet hell stage!\n• Meet 3 cute girls, each with a unique story and fully voiced in Japanese.\n• Collect hearts as you evade to gain access to more challenging levels!\n• Enjoy simple, one-handed controls.\n• Unlock saucy scenes with each female companion as you progress.\n• View CGs and animations you’ve earned in gallery mode!",
