    "description": "The only thing worse than entering a bullet hell shootout in deep space is not having the ability to shoot back, right? In Shuttlecock-H, that’s all part of the fun! Pilot your unarmed shuttle with absolute accuracy, and the 3 female companions you encounter will be sure to make it worth your trouble.\n\nShuttlecock-H is a naughty “dodge’em up” bullet hell game where you’ll need to evade enemies and projectiles while collecting hearts, up to 30 in each stage. Grab enough hearts and the girls will be wooed by your display of skill, unlocking the next level and a chance to get even closer to them. Each girl selected offers a different take on the story and a variety of increasingly spicy scenes to unlock, all voiced in Japanese!\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Dodge enemies and projectiles to clear each bullet hell stage!\n• Meet 3 cute girls, each with a unique story and fully voiced in Japanese.\n• Collect hearts as you evade to gain access to more challenging levels!\n• Enjoy simple, one-handed controls.\n• Unlock saucy scenes with each female companion as you progress.\n• View CGs and animations you’ve earned in gallery mode!",
