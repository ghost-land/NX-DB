    "description": "Hordes of zombies and bloodsucking bats, dozens of deadly mutants and cannibals, reanimated maniacs and pumpkin-killers — can you handle these mobs? You will have to survive through the night each and every time you’ll play Restless Night. This game is full of horrifying encounters with undead enemies, but your rifle will come in handy! Can you make it to the dawn? There’s only one way to find out — grab your favorite firearm and get ready to crush, kill and destroy all these zombies with classic old-school style. Made with love and taste, even your grandfather remembers this feeling and how fun it actually is!",
