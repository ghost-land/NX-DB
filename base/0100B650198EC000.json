    "description": "Dead Station is a new hit by Hoodoo Bear, the developers of Oliver's Adventures in the Fairyland. It’s an old school platforming experience set on the space station «Soyuz-1» overrun by some hostile monsters. Your task is to arm yourself with melee weapons and firearms, find any answers on what the hell happened there and survive no matter what!\n\nIt’s a new twist on the survival-action genre — you’ll have to use your wits and surroundings in order to progress through this station. Actually it’s not «dead», but more like «deadly»! Do you think you have what it takes to venture through these dangerous halls and corridors?",
