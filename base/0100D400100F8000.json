Instead, you play as a movement of people whose well-being determines the success of your revolution.\n\n“Tonight We Riot” is an unapologetically political, socialist game about worker liberation in the face of overpowering capitalism. It’s also quite a bit of fun to play.\"\n     -Variety\n\n\"...for all those folks who need to get out their political anger” \n    -USGamer\n\nCore Features:\n    * Couch co-op\n    * 20 unlockable weapons, gear, and perks\n    * A dog\n    * Whimsy\n    * Kaiju\n    * A wood chipper\n    * Endless Mode\n    * Horror Synth\n    * The unique catharsis that comes from throat-punching a billionaire ghoul who would rather watch the world and everyone on it burn than lose a tax break",
