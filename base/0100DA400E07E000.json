Uncover the amazing story, untangle the mystery and try to save your loved one.\n \nThis is not an easy task. It’s a huge open world area filled with dangers and anomalies.

The elements, combined with radiation and unexplained phenomenon, make the lovely looking environment a place where you shouldn’t be.  Yet, here you are.\n \nScavenge for resources inside any building and especially the landmarks of Pripyat: hotel Polissya, the cultural center, cinema Prometheus, the swimming pool and all the abandoned flat buildings. Craft and choose your gear wisely. Discover and use the campsites for safely passing the nights.  Equipment, weapons and the vehicles you may find and use are your only friends.\n \nGood luck!",
