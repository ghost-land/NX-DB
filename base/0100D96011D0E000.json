The only thing you know is that you’re tasked with a strange mission - collect all your debts!\n\nPick all the coins in 30 levels full of riddles, lethal traps, ruthless enemies...and time pressure! \nBe smart, be fast and make the best use of your hero’s assets: a rock-solid head that can crush blocks and some good ol’ explosives.\nYou also need to take advantage of your environment by pushing and placing boxes in a clever way.\n\nJust like in the golden days of gaming, enjoy some nice chiptune music, silly characters and pixel graphics and challenging puzzle-platforming action.\n",
