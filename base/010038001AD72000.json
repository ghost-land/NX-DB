    "description": "Do you want to become a hooligan, be respected by those around you and try any unethical way that can make you rich quickly?\nThen Hooligan Simulator is a perfect option for you, because you will be able to feel yourself what it is like to be in his\nrole and always have the law on your trail.\nThe city is an opportunity for a hooligan, as he can make a great reputation here and earn as much as possible. \nAll this has a negative side as the police are always looking for us.\nIn Hooligan Simulator, players have no future, they are devoid of money, career or any other assets.\nAll they have are the means to cause as much damage as possible to the city. These are tough guys best to avoid. \nWe will have to draw graffiti, smear public housing with paint and damage it. Become the one that no one messes with,\nbut the one that the police are looking for intensively because of his hooliganisms.\nAll these graffiti are posted by us and we get reputation in the networks, the higher the reputation, the more money we get.The most important thing is to know how to protect ourselves after every damage done to the city, we have to be careful not to be caught by the police and to see our interests through.",
