    "description": "Born of a love for traditional computer role-playing, Broken Roads provides a rich, engaging narrative in which players make their way across a desolated future Australia. Blending together traditional and all-new role-playing elements on top of a classless system offering nearly unlimited character development options, Broken Roads presents players with an original morality system: the Moral Compass. This novel design sees dialogue options and questing decisions influence, and be influenced by, a character's philosophical leaning.\n\nFeatures\n• All-new post-apocalyptic setting\n• Unique morality system influencing dialogue, quests and character development\n• Authentic Australian locations and environments\n• Blend of traditional and original RPG mechanics\n• Up to 5 party members\n• Turn-based tactical combat\n• Hand-drawn artwork\n• A content-rich and densely-crafted world",
