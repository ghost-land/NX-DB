    "description": "Take down alien invaders with the power of metal! \n\nOne night while on his way home from school, a high school boy is abducted by the Octoids, an extraterrestrial species bent on revenge. The boy's soul is transplanted into a high school girl's body in a sinister experiment. Now sharing a body, the duo must work together with her high school band, K.M.G. (Kichijoji Metal Girls) to defeat the aliens with their greatest weakness: metal!\n\nTurn the Joy-Con™ into a pair of drum sticks in this brand-new rhythm game experience! Memorize drum lines and jam to 13 tracks without any sheet music or rhythm icons. How you rock is up to you!\n\nHold the Joy-Con™ in your left and right hand as if they were real drum sticks and make music by swinging them up and down.\n(Gal Metal also supports standard button and Touch Screen input.)\n\nSwing the Joy-Con™ (R) for the kick drum, the Joy-Con™ (L) for the snare drum, and both at the same time for a cymbal crash. \n\nMemorize various rhythm patterns by practicing solo or with your band and deploy them however you like to build up your Metal Power in concert battles against the Octoids.\n\nJust using a single beat won’t be enough to rack up the points — showcase a variety of rhythm patterns and earn yourself combo bonuses. Master the art of metal and send those nasty aliens back where they came from!",
