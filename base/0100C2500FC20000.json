    "description": "Enter 4-on-4* ink-slinging battles in this colorful action shooter packed with style and attitude. As a squid-like Inkling, quickly cover your surroundings (and opponents) in ink with wild weaponry and swim through your own color to sneak and splat. Dive into the fresh fun with family and friends and make waves as a team. Get splatted by an opponent? No sweat! The goal in Turf War is to cover the most ground, so respawn and jump back into the inky action.\n\nKeep it current with rotating items, seasonal catalogs, and special events\n\nVariety is the spice of an Inkling’s life, so check out shops daily for a changing array of gear that is as fashionable as it is functional. Timed events like Splatfests bring different types of chaotic competition and content updates add even more weapons and stages. Earn points to get in-game items from season-specific catalogs to dress up your own personal locker and show your style.\n\nUse inky new abilities and weapons to compete, cooperate, or clear up the mystery of the Fuzzy Ooze\n\nDynamic new moves like the Squid Surge and Squid Roll will help you and your fellow Inklings cover more ground and avoid enemy ink. Take aim with the bow-like Stringer and get slash happy with sword-like Splatanas—these new weapon types join an arsenal of fresh special weapons and sub weapons, too. Work together to collect Golden Eggs and fend off brand-new swarms of invading Salmonids in the co-op Salmon Run mode. Tackle a solo adventure alongside a Smallfry companion to solve the mystery of the Fuzzy Ooze in the offline story mode.\n\n",
