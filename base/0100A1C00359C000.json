    "description": "TowerFall is the ultimate version of the beloved archery \ncombat/party game, featuring all of the content from \nAscension and Dark World, and several Switch-exclusive \nadditions!\n\nInspired by classics from the golden age of couch multiplayer, \nTowerFall centers around hilarious, intense versus matches - \nbest played against friends, sitting cross-legged on the floor \nwithin punching distance of each other.\n\nThe core mechanics are simple and accessible, but hard to \nmaster, with a huge amount of gameplay variants, arrow types, \npower-ups, and levels. And when you need a break from the \ncompetition, team up in 1-4 player co-op modes, where youâ€™ll \nfight off a wide variety of monsters, enemy archers, and \nbosses. \n\nThe Switch version includes several new and exclusive features, \nincluding 6-player battles utilizing widescreen levels, new \ngameplay variants, and guest archers Madeline and her \nreflection Badeline from fan-favorite platformer Celeste!",
