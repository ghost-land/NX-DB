    "description": "Arranger: A Role-Puzzling Adventure follows the story of Jemma, a small-town misfit on a journey of self-discovery. Venturing out beyond her stiflingly cozy confines, she finds an inspiring world - but also one ruled by fear, and a strange, immovable ‘static’ force. Can she disrupt a culture of stagnation, and find a place to fit into it?\n\nGameplay takes place on a unique, interconnected ‘grid’ that spans the entire world, snappily uniting movement, exploration, and combat. When Jemma moves, the world moves with her - creating both a playful sense of chaos, and a regular stream of small, thoughtful puzzles that twist and play with the central mechanic.\n\nFeatures:\n- Unique, interconnected gameplay ‘grid’ that snappily unites movement, combat, and exploration.\n- A story-driven adventure about a small-town misfit on a journey of self-discovery.\n- A breezy RPG without XP or inventory to manage, where everything is handled in-world.\n- A nicely-sized campaign with some optional challenges, and various assist options so that you only get as stuck as you want to be.\n- Debut game from an all-star development team, featuring the artist behind Braid.",
