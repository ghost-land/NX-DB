    "description": "Bomb Cat takes inspiration from classic 2048 games but elevates the challenge with an insane bomb mechanic. In other words, it’s pretty simple – match the fluffy cats carefully, and watch out – the bombastic Bomb Cat can either assist you or completely disrupt your game.\n\n\n2048 MATCH GAME WITH A BANG… OR A BOMB?\nThere are eleven fluffy cats, starting with sweet tiny blue kitten babies to match together. Each cat has a different weight depending on its size. Your goal is to achieve the highest score without running out of space.\n\nTo increase the challenge, a Bomb Cat will occasionally appear... to activate this kitty’s ability, it needs to touch the Flamey Cat. That’s when the explosion’s countdown starts! \n\nDepending on the circumstances, the blast can help you match smaller cats, as they will jump around the box, or end your game, as the cats can pop out of the open parcel and fly into space. Just like typical cats.\n\n\nBE A COMBO HERO\nTake the challenge of making your score furry freaking best. The more cats you match, the bigger your combo, which translates to more points.\n\nPlacing the cats strategically will help you maximize your score.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n– Eleven colorful cats to match like in classic 2048\n– Possibility of sending cats to the Moon and back\n– One special cat – Cat Bomb to make the game more challenging\n– Combo mechanic to make your score even better\n– Easy controlling, but challenging gameplay (sometimes)\n– Endless and addictive fun\n– Enjoyable music, which you can always turn off\n– Once again... CATS (No regrets, cats are superior to other animals; deal with it already)",
