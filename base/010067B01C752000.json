    "description": "\"Legend tells of the city of Ys, a cultural jewel built on the coast of Brittany. While it prospered under the rule of the wise king Gradlon, the golden age of Ys didnâ€™t last forever. Fierce conflict between Queen Tehda and her sister led to catastrophe and the entire city was swallowed up by the ocean. The king barely escaped, but both sisters drowned within the city walls. It is said that King Gradlon still stands by the shore, waiting for the city to rise up from the ocean floor and reunite him with his beloved.\n\nAmelia, the top Myth Seekers agent, is called to Paris - only to discover that the agency has been compromised. She quickly realizes that it might be connected to a mysterious artifact found near a possible location of the mythical city of Ys. \n\nJoin Amelia and scour the alleys of Paris in search of echoes of that legendary cataclysm. Discover the hidden truth and make sure that the mysterious forces responsible for this tragedy remain dormant.  There's no time to lose! And be warned, the legend also says that when Ys rises up from beneath the waves, Paris will be swallowed up in its place.\"\n",
