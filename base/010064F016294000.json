Developed in 1990, this game is a fan favorite of the old retro games.\n\nThe game consists of the player controlling an unnamed sorcerer, apprentice of Mordamir. The sorcerer faces various deadly creatures and traps in a dungeon, where at each stage he discovers more details about the story of his journey and finding new allies, items and dangers. \n\nThe player must solve puzzles, avoid deathtraps, use magic spells (in the form of books and scrolls), and acquire various items in order to survive the labyrinth.\n",
