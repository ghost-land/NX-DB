    "description": "You can trigger the mechanisms with your energy orb,\nRemember that some things need to be triggered if you want to get through!\nOnly this energy orb will not trigger anything!\nIt also allows you to TELEPORT to it, so you can easily access places you can't reach and even escape from some enemies and tracks!,\nYou also have a balloon that allows you to float, you'll see it in the next levels, it will be useful for sure!,\nThe game is not as easy as it looks unfortunately, the engineers who built this lab are engineers, I'm sure they wouldn't want you to be able to pass easily, right?",
