    "description": "Kropki 8 is an abstract strategy game, played by two or more people. The game is superficially similar to Go, in that the goal is to \"capture\" enemy dots by surrounding them with a continuous line of one's own dots. Once an area containing enemy dots is surrounded, that area ceases to be playable.\n\n- Choose scoring system: occupy territory vs. capture enemy dots\n- Different time modes for different play tempo (from 5 sec per move to 30 mins total)\n- Multiple color themes (for both day and night times)\n- Up to 8 players support\n- Ambient soundtrack for intense mind battles\n\n\n",
