Well... now you have a chance!\n\nGrab your weapon, call out your battle drones and start clicking the car into oblivion! Earn cash, upgrade your equipment and find more vehicles to destroy!\n\nTons of upgrades, support weapons, special abilities and explosions! Taste the destruction at it's best in this clicker game.\n\nWe put much effort into graphical detail and design to bring you a high quality product. Alley in the night, construction site or gas station are some of the beautiful stages we have cooked up for you.\n\nTry to destroy different types of cars - from a Van through american Truck to a massive Bulldozer. Break the window, smash the hood, blow the tires and in the end blast them with a rocket launcher.\n\nOur main goal was to create a unique clicker experience - in both graphics and gameplay. You will see cool destruction mechanics, nice visual effects, car paint that gets more and more scratched. But what brings even more fun - is buying those high level support weapons.\n\nIf that's not enough - use stage hazards like explosive barrels or call upon your battle drones to destroy the cars faster and earn even more gold!\n\nYou will love those tools of destruction. But beware - boss fight can be tricky!\nBetter buy some damage perks - just in case!",
