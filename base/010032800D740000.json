    "description": "You live a monotonous and repetitive lonely life in a cold overpopulated ever-expanding city. The phone is distracting you with meaningless notifications as you move through anonymous crowds on your way to work at a megacorporation where yet another long day with overtime awaits. You have no real sense of meaning - until one crucial day, when strange things start to happen on your commute to work and everything changes. \n\nMosaic is a dark surrealistic and atmospheric adventure game about urban isolation and the dread of being a piece in a giant machinery you canâ€™t understand. \n\nFrom the creators of Among the Sleep, Krillbite Studio is going from horrors of childhood to the dreadful lonely adult life.",
