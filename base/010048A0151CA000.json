    "description": "Head over Heels is an isometric puzzle/platform game with two playable characters that have been captured, separated and imprisoned in the castle, Head and Heels.\n\nHead can shoot enemies to solve puzzles, as long as he’s collected enough donut ammo to do so, and jump higher than Heels, that is way faster and early in the game gets the ability to carry a single object within one screen only. \n\nThe player will have to use and combine all of their powers to get them both out of the castle and do all of the puzzles that are ahead.\n",
