    "description": "After the macabre and horrific events suffered in the second chapter of Baobabs Mausoleum, here comes the final episode full of sordid stays in limbo, golf courses watched over by enchilada-shaped clouds, trips to the internet of the Marianas and a final outcome with a high risk of causing you very negative effects both in the eyesight and in the brain; the final episode of Baobabs Mausoleum is here ready to make you completely crazy.  \n\n Welcome to Flamingo's Creek. 64 inhabitants",
