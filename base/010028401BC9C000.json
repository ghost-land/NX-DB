    "description": "The boys are back and ready for some arcade-style action in Otoko Cross: Pretty Boys Breakup! The original cast of Jules, Quincy, Haru, Morgan and Kyun are joined by 4 newcomers, all with unique backstories and voiced in Japanese. As you play through challenging brick-breaking stages of arcade action, you’ll get closer to the boys by spending points you’ve earned in a new in-game shop system to unlock feminine crossdressing outfits and background images to assemble custom dioramas.\n\nThe brick-breaking stages of Pretty Battle mode gradually increase in difficulty. Take control a twin-tailed fighter wielding a beam saber and swat the ball towards block targets above. Some blocks drop power-ups, while others take multiple strikes to break. As the action intensifies, enemy ships will appear and fire at you, propellers will deflect shots, turrets will track your position and more, adding a tough-but-fair bullet hell element. Once you’ve cleared all 36 main stages, you can also push your limits with endless challenges. How long can you last?\n\nFeatures:\n\n• Battle through 36 stages of brick-breaking arcade action!\n• Meet a cast of 9 crossdressing “otokonoko” characters, all voiced in Japanese.\n• Change ball speeds, collect power-ups, dodge enemy attacks and deflect incoming fire.\n• Master 2 unique game modes, including endless challenges for unlimited replay value!\n• Earn points to exchange for new outfits and backdrops in any order you desire.\n• Assemble custom dioramas using the characters and clothing you’ve unlocked.",
