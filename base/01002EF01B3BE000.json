    "description": "Embark on an adventurous journey through the world of valleys in Bee in The Valley! Discover wild, forest, and mountain valleys, filled with unexpected fun moments and exciting challenges.\n\nYour goal as a bee is to explore these unknown valleys, searching for flowers and collecting nectar to make honey in the hive. But don't be fooled, it's not as easy as it seems. Learn to fly like a real bee in the characteristic zigzag style known as the 'Dance Bee'.\n\nEach mission becomes more challenging, with increasing time pressure. Your time limit is determined by the honey percentage in the hive, and the pace of honey consumption accelerates with each mission. Fly faster, collect more flowers, and unlock new valleys.\n\nBut beware! In each valley, you'll encounter surprising rivals such as bears, hornets, spiders, hedgehogs, birds, and bats. Outsmart them to successfully complete your missions. The key moment in the game is a special mission where you must defend your beehive. Take control and attack the bear using your powerful sting! Show your defensive skills and protect your home.\n\nRemember, you can't discover more valleys alone. Expand your bee family and gain support from unique bee friends. Each bee has individual skills that contribute to your success:\n\nYellow Bee: Talented but not very hardworking.\nGreen Lady Bee: The youngest bee with lightning-fast wing flapping.\nOrange Bee: Fluffy and fat, with a great appetite.\nBlue Bee: A swift and agile flyer among bees.\nRed Bee: Sharp as a needle, always hitting the mark.\nThe White Lady Bee: Miss Hive, the most beautiful bee who flies swiftly and collects ample nectar.\n\nUnleash your flying skills, overcome challenges, and become the ultimate bee in the valleys. Explore, collect, and defend in the world of Bee in The Valley!",
