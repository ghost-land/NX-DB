    "description": "The Wake is the last of game developer Somi’s “Guilt Trilogy,” consisting of Replica and Legal Dungeon.\n\n“Perhaps it means my life simply boils down to this: ‘Everything I say is a lie.’”\n\nThe Wake is a record of past wounds opened at a three-day funeral—a record of the roots of guilt, and the memories and emotions that chain together three generations of a family.\n\nThe journal is encoded with a simple substitution cipher that the player must break in order to reveal the writer’s psyche and discover the contradictions that define him.",
