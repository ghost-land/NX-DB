    "description": "The retro-hardcore topdown masterpiece was carefully crafted during 5 years of community feedback, carrying over 4k sprites, tribal drums, fuzzed guitars and flawless gameplay.\n\nThe players can choose a Saint, tune it to fit their gameplay style and try to survive a gun-filled pit where you can cut bullets with swords, unleash havoc with psionic powers, and evade hells of projectiles.\n\nEach character is a love letter to ARCADE games, like Kore, inspired on classic shmup gameplay or Aya that calls for a progressive combo score beater.\n\nA hardboiled egg of the Brazilian underground game development scene and a Must-Buy for the finest tasted ARCADE enthusiasts!",
