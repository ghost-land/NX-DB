    "description": "Yes! Oh my gosh! Hell yeah!\n \nThis long-promised day has finally come with the release of the game that kills not only your time but your calories as well!\n \nThe return of the legendary Lord of the Click has happened so suddenly and with a number «II» on the end.\n \nSome might say: «Pffft! Why does perfection need a sequel?»\nWe’ll reply with: «Pffft! This is a perfect sequel to perfection!» (with a number «II» on the end).\nYou will ask us: «Are there any new features that you, a respected Kazakh game developer, have incorporated into your flawless masterpiece?»\nI’ll smile lightly, sit firmly on my armchair and will tell you without any hesitation: \n «My boy, we’ve added a cooperative mode for you, pal. And now you can learn the truth about this very important thing — who mashes the button faster, you or your granny?».\n \nAdd this feature to another set of new options: epic in-game campaign created with updated visuals, gameplay innovations for nerds who prefer to consider their moves during the game session, and finally this top-notch marketing text that will help you to buy this game without further ado. Your arms are basically targeted to press that PURCHASE button. Or do they not?\n",
