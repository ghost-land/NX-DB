    "description": "You're not piloting the ship. You ARE the ship:\nSentient ships have been outlawed for centuries. With the help of your holo-companion C.O.R.G.I. and your (mostly) loyal crew, you’ve managed to evade capture. Now there's an entire galaxy between you and freedom.\n\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End is a narrative space opera that’ll have you soaring around the universe assembling an unruly crew from an eclectic cast of characters. Take any job you can to keep one step ahead of your abusive ex, and keep flying towards freedom.\n\n• Recruit a crew of fellow outcasts: Along your travels, bring aboard an eclectic crew from a diverse cast of characters with their own stories and skill sets. Who will you bring on your adventure?\n\n• Odd jobs for an odd crew: Supplies don’t come for free in the ‘verse, doubly so for outlawed sentient spaceships. Every planet, moon and space station is a valuable source of jobs and their precious rewards. Assign crew tasks based on their skills, and help guide their decisions along the way.\n\n• Buckle up for an intergalactic adventure: Fly across a unique galaxy as you explore planets, moons and space stations. Discover the dust-bitten badlands of the Rim, the techno-industrial megacities of the Core…and Beyond!\n\nA Long Journey to an Uncertain End presents a unique vision of the future, a universe of inclusivity and diversity tainted by uncertainty and fear. Every crew member has their own story, every planet its own history, and even your own adventure remains unfinished.\n\nSo...where to next, Captain?",
