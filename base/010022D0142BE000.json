His partner feels this is the perfect opportunity for Jordan to finally introduce him to his teammates.\n• Jenny: As a student at the prestigious Waters University, Jenny has always had good grades. However, a few weeks before her midterms, she can no longer focus on her studies and is anxious about getting to class.\n• Paul Hitik: Paul is one of the 5 candidates in the Waters mayoral election. He is aware that his city is the place of many injustices and intends to defend his candidacy to change things on a large scale.\n\nKEEP IN TOUCH WITH THEIR RELATIVES\nWith dozens of side characters, Best Day Ever deepens many relationships of friendship, love and rivalry.
