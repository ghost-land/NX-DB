    "description": "【Introduction】\nThe story is set in a world two years after a major bioterrorist attack that killed 170,000 people.\nThe story's protagonist, a journalist, miraculously survived that atrocity and has since devoted himself to solving the mystery of the attacks.\nAs our story begins, he receives a phone call. The caller tells him they wish to reveal the truth behind the virus used in the attacks two years ago...\nSkeptical, he nevertheless follows the directions he has been given and finds himself arriving at a deserted mansion.\nWhat he encounters there is beyond belief...\n\n【Game Play】\nThe aim of the game is to use a range of weapons, including handguns, shotguns, and rocket launchers, to defeat terrifying monsters and escape from the mansion and laboratory.\nThis survival-action horror game is a classic FPS. The player is constantly forced to choose to either fight against their enemies or flee to safety. This management of the limited items available creates gameplay imbued with a sense of palpable tension.\nThe game also features multiple endings, meaning that the game's conclusion changes dramatically based on the player's actions.\n\n【About QuietMansion1】\nThe original game, released in 2018 as \"KENGOHAZARD,\" has been remade using modern technology and development techniques. With an all-new map, the title has evolved so much that it plays like an entirely new game.\n\n【Audio】\nThe first game to feature the independently developed Enhanced Real Sound Effect (ERSE) audio system.\nThe atmosphere generated by the 3D audio effects creates a brand-new horror experience unlike anything seen before.\n\n【Game Overview】\nTitle: QuietMansion1\nGenre: FPS survival action horror\nHashtag: #QuietMansion",
