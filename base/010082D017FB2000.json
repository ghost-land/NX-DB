Collect the photos from obscure corners and angles to reveal the underlying story, one photo at a time.\n\n【Get Unstuck with Thoughtful Hints】\nThere is a multitude of guidance systems to help prevent players from getting stuck. Focus can be activated to highlight the key items to the solution, while hint texts are available to provide further clarity. And, if all else fails, video walkthroughs can be unlocked as the ultimate safety plan.\n\n【Prove Your Puzzle-Solving Skills with Medals】\nThere are a total of 15 achievements in the game, each corresponding with a Medal that has been crafted with a uniquely stunning design.
