    "description": "I dream of you and ice cream is a game about imperialism, the loss of identity and personal sacrifice.\n\nA sinister, doll-like entity has enslaved all mankind. Inside the complex where, every day, the entity questions world leaders about aspects of humanity - a potentially lethal process - an old scientist of unspecified gender is building a machine.\n\nClinging to a few precious memories, with each passing day the scientist gathers components and toils on their obscure project, as the clock ticks relentlessly towards a horrifying climax.\n\nI dream of you and ice cream is a point-and-click adventure game with a very simple interface and an emphasis on puzzle solving. For every two puzzles solved, players are rewarded with a partial solution which can be used in another puzzle.\n\nThere are no spoken lines or written dialogue in the game: Everything is communicated through speech bubbles, symbols and emotions.",
