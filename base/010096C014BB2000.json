    "description": "Dead Dust takes place in the Wild West. It’s full of reckless gunfights, gunpowder smell, endless prairies and hot-headed cowboys. The main character is called Shlango, and he’s a fearless bounty hunter. He receives a letter from a very important person with great influence all over the Wild West. He owns many saloons and bars. His daughter was kidnapped and so he wrote a letter to the bounty hunter asking him for help with saving her. This job appears extremely dangerous because Shalngo’s path lies through the land of Tribals. Fortunately our hero Shlango has some reliable friends ready to help him on this dangerous journey and get to the horses any minute!\n\nIt’s time for you to pick a hero and run through the crowds of deadly enemies: angry Indians, bandits and even some aliens with their futuristic plasma cannons. You will have to stay alive through all of these challenging levels, also you will have to collect loot from fallen enemies. There are some things to be done as well — to discover the secrets of Dead Dust and talk to barkeepers who’ll sell you the most useful equipment to overcome any obstacles or hostels on your way to save the kidnapped girl.",
