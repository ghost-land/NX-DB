    "description": "Not just the looks of a classic game, also the gameplay of a classic platformer. This game is NOT EASY! you have an endless amount of lives, so you can quickly restart a level when you miss a jump, get hit by an enemy, get bitten by a plant, get hit by a spiky-ball, crushed by big statues, run onto spikes, get hit by a wasp, or any of the other many ways you'll get stopped in your run.\n\n\nBUT when you do complete a level, the rush you get will keep you coming back for more, and more, and more, and.. \n\nUnlock special temple levels by finding hidden keys, unlock a flip-mode by completing a level both within the time set, and also by collecting all the coins in a level.\n\nStardash is all about the gameplay thrown at you in awesome retro graphics and original chiptunes. \n\n",
