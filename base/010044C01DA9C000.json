    "description": "One Last Breath tells a story about despair but also about hope. Even if the post-apocalyptic world of this 2.5D adventure is withered, Gaia’s powers might be enough to restore life. That won’t be easy, though. Lots of fearsome mutants will hunt her mercilessly.\n\nBorn from mother nature’s very last breath, Gaia has the ability to control the environment. Create paths using trunks, summon vines to hang between gaps, and solve puzzles using your powers to save our planet.\n\nHumanity doesn’t exist anymore. Decades of pollution and greed have driven it to absolute extinction. However, its echo still can be heard. Along her journey, Gaia will visit abandoned factories filled with hazardous, human-made obstacles. How are they still working?\n\nGaia’s adventure is all about balance. She will find both brutality and tenderness while trying to survive strange creatures and protect the defenceless ones. Only our world can be as ruthless as charming.",
