    "description": "Play as the heroic space warrior Stella Mironova and explore a world filled with excitement and danger. In Cosmos Bit, you'll relive the 8-bit era charm again in a game that draws inspiration from classic platform action exploration titles of the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nThe journey will take you through a litany of landscapes, battles with a myriad of monsters, mind-warping challenges, and even menacing boss encounters! Can you collect minerals in each level to build up your powers to go further? \n\nThe challenge is significant but not frustrating, and the game is enjoyable for both veterans and beginners of this genre! \n\n\nFeatures\n* A tribute to the Metroidvania genre!\n* Retrogaming pixel art style!\n* High-level Synth Wave soundtrack by Jake D. Bind!",
