    "description": "Why do tumbleweeds tumble?\nWhere are the best tumbling fields?\nWhat lies beyond the tumbled...?\n\n\"Hey, do you want to tumble with me?\"\n\nGame overview:\nThe game system is similar to a clicker game. The difference from clickers is that you do not earn points by clicking, but by tumbling weed and breaking cacti.\nOperate tumbleweeds and explore the wilderness. Through their adventures, they grow, learn new truths, meet new friends, and experience a variety of things.\nTumbleweeds earn TP (Tumble points) by moving. Use the TP you earn to gain abilities and increase your TP even more efficiently.\n\nFeature:\nOnline multiplayer: Up to 16 players can play together. There are quick matches and friend matches, both of which you are free to enter and exit at any time. In Quick Match, soaps from all over the world are trying to reach the soap holder at their own pace. In Friend Match, you can easily play with specific friends only by using one keyword. Of course, you can also play alone.\n\nGrowth: You can use the TP (tumble points) you get from rolling to grow.\n\nLiving proof there: Tumbleweeds are alive. What is alive will eventually die. But when the plant dies, a new life will sprout in it.",
