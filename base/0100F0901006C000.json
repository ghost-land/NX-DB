    "description": "Ever wanted to feed your friends to zombies, but the pesky law is in your way?\n\nWell, want no longer, welcome to A Sound Plan.\n\nA Sound Plan is a local competitive arena game about using sound to manipulate zombies into attacking your friends, or enemies, we don't judge. Kill your foes in one of two ways: bash their skulls in with rocks (always fun), or lure zombies into them using sounds generated by throwing rocks into walls or other people. Be violent, be passive, we don't care, just take each other out!\n\nGood players will win by controlling their foes through managing their limited number of rocks to put themselves into advantageous situations.\n\nTread carefully, plan ahead, it's the only way to survive.",
