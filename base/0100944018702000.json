    "description": "Kaichu is a dating sim about kaiju! You play the role of Gigachu, a gigantic romantic looking for love. Meet six other eligible kaiju and visit twenty-four famous landmarks where Gigachu will answer challenging compatibility questions to decide the fate of your relationship.\n\nLANGUAGE OF LOVE\nDon't worry if you're new to romance or don't speak any love languages because kaiju are notoriously non-verbal.

Through the reporters’ expert analysis, the player learns about the preferences of the kaiju and apply that knowledge during each date’s relationship quiz to progress the story.\n\nDEMOLITION DATING\nKaiju communicate through a destructive courtship ritual. Love interests will prompt Gigachu with questions to compare compatibility, and the relationship grows stronger or weaker depending on how well your answers match up.
