    "description": "Lost deep below the earth, trapped in ancient ruins, the two of you must work together to overcome the trials of these forgotten depths and escape. But it’s not all cooperation and teamwork - you each must try to escape with The Jade Statue, a mysterious and ancient relic of untold value. Only one of you can have the relic, and down here? Anything goes.\n\nPuzzle your way through three distinct areas of the ruins, with each offering a distinct set of curious challenges to overcome. Not only that, each area adds new traps, tools, and devious devices to help you get an edge on your “friend” and secure The Jade Statue. But be careful as you dig deeper through the remnants of this lost civilization - the distant rumbling sounds like you’re not the only ones trapped down here…\n\nUse a Joy-Con™ each to explore Dyadic’s hidden depths with a friend on the go, or grab a single controller to share, opening up new possibilities for twisting, shoving, and other unscrupulous tactics*. But if you want a more traditional experience, don’t worry, you can use two controllers to claw your way out of the underground together instead.\n\n*We are not liable for any broken controllers or broken friendships that result from this.\n",
