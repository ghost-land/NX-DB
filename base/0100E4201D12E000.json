Discover hundreds of real locations, set up vital trade routes, and search local markets for new goods to trade.\n\nBattle on land and sea!\nArm yourself to the teeth with a plethora of swords, guns, cannons and armour as you fight against pirates, thieves, wild animals and mythical creatures. Can you become the master and commander of a unique \"\"rock-paper-scissors\"\" turn-based combat system?\n\nCustomize your ship!\nLoad your vessel up to the deck with cannons and it will be formidable in combat, but you'll need to make sure you have the necessary cargo space for resources to support your crew.
