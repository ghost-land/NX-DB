Chase down each of the Space Cat Pirates, building platforms as you go. Use whatever it takes: springs, whips, umbrellas, cannons... Nothing can stop Pompom!\n\nSTORY\nOne day Pompom was working up a sweat on his hamster wheel, when Hoshi the boy burst into the room, showing a hand of beautiful jewels that fell from the sky with a great ‘BOOM’. Suddenly, Captain Cat & his crew appeared into the room, kidnapping Hoshi into a portal to space. Now Pompom must go on an adventure to save his boy Hoshi from the eight Space Cat Pirates!\n\nGAMEPLAY\nTake a breath of fresh air in the platformer genre: you do not control Pompom the hamster, but instead help him by moving platforms and items around him.
