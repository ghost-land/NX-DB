    "description": "Let's begin with «hard» — this word has been created by some sore loser and douchebag. Only the person who can't be trusted will label video games with those, and not video games only!\n\nWho has the right to decide what is easy and what is not for another man? That's why you won't see any self-praising words regarding Pukan, Bye-Bye difficulty in this description. Only by playing yourself you'll be able to estimate if it's hard or not hard enough. In the meantime, I'll give you an advice to get more patience. Frankly speaking, I found myself not having enough of it.",
