With 5 new game modes, 15 dynamic locations and 120 challenges, gear up for spectacular combats, brutal opponents, and endless opportunities to refine your moves.\n\nIs one life enough to have Kung Fu?\nWhether you choose to play as a male or a female character, in Sifu, you will ponder that question on your path for revenge, hunting down your family’s assassins. One against all, you have no allies, countless enemies, and a mysterious amulet to bring you back to life every time you die. Yet, be warned! Your secret weapon comes at a hefty price to pay: aging and its consequences. \n\nLearning by fire \nYour enemies don’t wait their turn, and they don’t broadcast their intent.

Use everything at your disposal: throwable objects, makeshift weapons, windows and ledges... The odds are stacked against you, and you will be offered no mercy.\n\nTraining never ends\nKung Fu is mastery through practice, a path for both the body and the mind.
