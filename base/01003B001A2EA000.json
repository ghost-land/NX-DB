    "description": "Bonze Adventure is an action game released by TAITO in 1988. Enma, king of the underworld, once kept order in his domain. However, one day, he suddenly lost his mind and plunged the underworld into chaos. This prompts Buddha to ask high priest Kackremboh from the mortal world to exorcise the evil from Enma. Buddha also granted Kackremboh prayer beads as a weapon for his mission, sending him off to battle the demons, ghosts, and even Lord Enma.\n\nThe \"Arcade Archives\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic Arcade masterpieces.\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time. Players can also compete against each other from all over the world with their high scores.\nPlease enjoy the masterpiece that built a generation for video games.",
