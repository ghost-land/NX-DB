No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\n\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT’s polished, minimalist visual language helps you focus on what's most important – the fluid gameplay and the cinematic beauty of the fight.\n\nSUPERHOT features:\n• Endless Mode – how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?\n• Challenge Mode – take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.\n• Extras – delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].\n\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.",
