Children playfully discover vegetables, sunflowers, fruit, and much more by fitting moving objects into predetermined shapes. But it's not just about vegetables and fruit—letters and numbers are also part of the adventure, allowing kids to playfully expand their knowledge of the alphabet and math.\n\nIn the main screen, a funny sheep greets you on its farm. Here, you can choose from various game levels, each containing different peg puzzles. These puzzles challenge children to recognize shapes, colors, and sizes, and to match objects accordingly. Whether it's an apple, an onion, or the letter \"A,\" each puzzle presents a new challenge.\n\nAs children solve the puzzles, they collect golden stars as rewards. These stars can be used to unlock a fun memory card game. In this game, they go up against a virtual cat, trying to find matching pairs of cards. The memory game enhances memory development and adds extra fun.\n\nThis educational game is perfect for young children who want to develop their motor skills and logical thinking while enjoying an entertaining journey through the farm. Thanks to the touch-screen interface of the Nintendo Switch™, the gameplay is easy and intuitive, making it ideal for preschoolers and early elementary school children.\n\nGet ready to explore the farm as you discover shapes, colors, and sizes, and unlock the fun memory game! A game for the whole family to enjoy.",
