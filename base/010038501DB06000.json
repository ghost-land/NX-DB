    "description": "The goal of the game is to achieve a high score by strategically dropping fruits into a container without letting them overflow. Players earn points by successfully combining two identical fruits, resulting in the creation of a new fruit in the game's evolving fruit cycle. Skillful and efficient fruit combinations not only contribute to a higher score but also add a layer of strategic depth to the gameplay. Can you master the art of fruit pairing and reach the top of the leaderboard?",
