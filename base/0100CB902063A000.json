    "description": "\nReleased by Riverhill Soft in 1986 in Japan, \"Murder Club\" is a command-based adventure game where players take on the role of Detective J.B. Harold to solve a case.\n\nThe game's most notable feature is that it is an adventure game tailored for adults. Unlike typical games designed for children, it lacks flashy developments and instead progresses through careful information gathering and extensive reasoning. While this may seem somewhat understated, this style of gameplay and presentation has been well-received by many fans, earning it recognition as a pioneer in the mystery adventure genre, with its name still widely known today.\n\nAs indicated by the tagline at the time, \"The Case Files of Detective J.B. Harold,\" this is just one of the many cases solved by Detective J.B. Harold, and numerous sequels have since been released.\n\n\n*This application does not have a scene select mode.\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
