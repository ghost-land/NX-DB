    "description": "Imagine a cardboard box. Is it shaped to fit one to two fluffy felines? What about five? What about twenty?\n\nFit My Cat presents you with many cute kitties that all wish to sit where they deem fit. That being said, we're running out of space and we are seriously looking for a cat organizer. If you could spare a moment or two to make that happen we would be grateful.\n\nEvery single one of them is trained and well-equipped for some spatial management – pick them up and rotate them as you see fit.\n\nJust so you're aware, some boxes might come with yarn balls or entire cathouses – but that will not prevent those spunky kitties from trying to get inside.\n\nTest your skills and show the world that herding cats is where fun begins!\n\nKEY FEATURES\n- Over 90 pawesome levels of cardboard boxes, ready to be filled with fluff\n- Tons of purrfect cats of varying shapes, colors, and sizes\n- Meowtastic soundtrack",
