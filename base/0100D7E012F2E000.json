    "description": "Dustoff Z is a game about maneuvering combat-helicopters in one of the harshest weather conditions possible – A Zombie Apocalypse. \n\nHire gunners to ride along and engage in a variety of missions such as rescue operations, convoy defense, and high-value target destruction. \n\nTrain and improve a gallery of different shooters, as well as upgrade and maintain a bunch of different helicopters – all with their own unique playstyle. \n\nUse your chopper’s winch to interact with the environment. Pick up supply drops, place base defenses, bring back the largest zombies for analysis, or why not use a shipping container as a battle ram? ",
