You are Watcher. You dutifully fulfil your purpose in service of the ALLMOTHER, until the day you learn a shocking secret that changes everything.\n\nIn the near future, a mysterious alien race of giant entities arrives. We call them the Occupants.\n\nThey are not hostile, but it doesn’t matter. Their arrival is a death sentence. Humanity is wiped out in a matter of months, succumbing to a disease the Occupants have brought to our planet.\n\nA teenage girl called Iris is the only survivor. Somehow she is not only immune but also becomes immortal.\n\n1000 years later, Iris has birthed a new society consisting exclusively of her own clones. \n\nShe calls them Sisters. They call her the ALLMOTHER.  They live safe in the Orchard, an underground bunker, whilst Iris wages war on the Occupants.\n\nBut all is not well. Your closest sister, Fixer, comes to you with a dangerous revelation. You have been lied to. The ALLMOTHER is not what she claims to be. After Fixer is executed for treason, it falls to you to discover the truth.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n• RELIVE THE MEMORIES OF A GOD - As Watcher, your role is to relive and interpret the memories of the All Mother through a process called Communions. \n• DISCOVER THE TRUTH - Explore pivotal moments in the life of the ALLMOTHER from high school days and the arrival of the Occupants to the creation of the Orchard and the birth of the first sisters.\n• JUMP BACK AND FORTH IN TIME - within memories you can skip forwards and back in time.
