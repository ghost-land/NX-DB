    "description": "The power of Xenonature..\n\nIn the future year of 2011, Zeta Reak, kind, gentle king of the Xenolians, is overthrown by a powerful tyrant named the \"Xenogunner\".\n\nThe Xenogunner is a mysterious being capable of many frightening feats, using a power known as \"Xenonature\", a powerful energy that grants one trained in the use of it many elemental and non-elemental powers.\n\nZeta, too, is gifted with the powers of Xenonature. It's up to Zeta to overthrow the Xenogunner and reclaim the throne...\n\n...but is the Xenogunner actually the one pulling the strings...?\n\nIntense Boss Battles!\n\nXenogunner is an intense boss-focused run-and-gun platformer based on games from the days of 16-bit consoles. With the addition of conveniences like mouse aiming and highly customizable difficulty settings, we believe that we've truly modernized a classic game genre that started in decades long since past.\n\nThe stages are short, the bosses are challenging, varied, and tense, and we give you as many lives as you'll need... because you'll need as many lives as you can get! Can Zeta best the Xenogunner...? Only you can guide him to victory!",
