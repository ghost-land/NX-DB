    "description": "The evil king Galgear and his generals have been resurrected after being sealed away for thousands of years and immediately begin their conquest of the human world and the Dreamland, currently ruled by Queen Valna. \n\nWith the Warrior of Valis Yuko now in the Heavens and unable to return to the other worlds, there is no one left to stand against Galgear. This is where the new protagonist Lena makes her appearance.\n\nJust like in Valis III before it, players can swap between 3 playable characters at any time. With increased difficulty compared to the previous entries in the series, players have more ways than ever to enjoy clearing stages. The visuals in Valis IV, which includes animated cutscenes with Japanese voice acting that are an absolute must-see, are the best in the series. ",
