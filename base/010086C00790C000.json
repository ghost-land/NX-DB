    "description": "Warlock's Tower is a retro puzzler with elegantly designed levels around one simple rule - one move equals one life lost. Playing as mailman Tim, you must brave the tower and its complex rooms of maddening puzzles, in a bid to reach the top and deliver a peace offering to the Warlock.\n\nClearing each room wonâ€™t be easy, though! Every step you take costs a life point, monsters and traps are everywhere, and some rooms require two characters working in tandem to proceed!\n\nDelivering the post has never been so challenging. Watch your step!\n\nFeatures:\n * Solve 100+ increasingly complex rooms\n * Outwit zombies, flying eyes, & slimes. Your ever-diminishing steps are far from the only danger.\n * Feel the 80s! Retro, 8-bit aesthetics make you feel like you're playing your favourite handheld again.",
