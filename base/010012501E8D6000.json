This is where Rose had settled to find inner peace in her old age after the life she’s had…\n\nWhat made her life so special, you ask?\n\nRose is not an ordinary grandmother – she has a home full of wondrous items and stories to tell. All her life she was a globetrotter, an adventurer – but without dangerous artifacts to deal with.\n\nADVENTERES AROUND THE WORLD \n\nDiscover Asia, Europe, and the Amazon rainforest and feel like a child again, while listening to grandmother's colorful stories alongside Amelia and the adorable corgi doggie.\n\nWhile helping unpack Rose’s things together with Amelia, you will find plenty of interesting artifacts that she took from her escapades around the world. They will help you get a better picture of the memories she wants to share with you and let you traverse through the images of her past.\n\nGoing through the adventure, you will have many puzzles to solve, which will help you discover the wonders Rose has hidden. Help out Amelia with writing everything down in the diary, and make all these stories even better with her imagination.\n\nFollowing Rose’s footsteps will lead you to historical sites all over the world. First will be the journey through the Amazon rainforest in search of Aztec legends, then through the Yunnan region in China – where the masters of brewing tea lay. Last but not least, you will find yourself on board the Orient Express and its magical first route – from Paris to Istanbul.\n\nWill this busy summer full of memories and adventure bring together two generations, that thought they had so little in common until now?\n\nPICTURE ADVENTURE\n\nDespite the remarkable stories we have to tell, Tell Me Your Story is also a beautiful eye-catching minimalist game with hand-drawn scenes, where there’s no need for any words – everything is brought together in your imagination, enhanced by the colorful images and puzzles.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\n- Multiple puzzles to solve\n- A heartwarming story about the family bond\n- A corgi dog – Peanut\n- Minimalistic cozy graphic design\n- Wonderful OST, to smooth your gameplay experience",
