    "description": "Named for an alternate-history London’s most famous entertainment, Circus Electrique combines enthralling, story-driven RPG tactics and circus management with a steampunk twist. When everyday Londoners mysteriously turn into vicious killers, only Circus Electrique's talented performers can save the city. The “Greatest Campaign Mode on Earth'' places these talented individuals in tactical turn-based battles. Crazed Bobbies, British Sailors gone bad, aggressive Posh Girls, and other Victorian-era archetypes stand in their way. Circus Electrique’s innovative Devotion morale system affects characters’ performance not only in battles, but also for actual circus shows, dutifully managed between heroic jaunts through six sprawling districts.\n\nKey Features:\nElectrifying RPG Combat \nTest the skills of Strongmen, Fire Blowers, Escape Artists, Clowns, and other classic circus performers – 15 playable archetypes total, each with deep tactical options in battle. Assemble the most ideal combination of acrobatic artists to fight against over-the-top enemies. \n\nManage the Greatest Show in Steampunk London\nDespite the chaos, the show must go on! Rebuild the circus to its former greatness and beyond, recruiting and training the most talented performers coming in from all over the world. Performers’ skill, chemistry with one another, and overall Devotion combine to determine the monetary success of a single show – and you’ll need every single spare Shilling you can get both for Amelia’s quest and to keep everyone paid and happy.    \n\nA Circus Like No Other\nImmerse yourself in a striking world based on vintage circus posters, Victorian-era archetypes and classic steampunk charm.",
