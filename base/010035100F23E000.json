    "description": "Get yourself a little summer's day with a raspberry jam adventure!\n\nVarenje is a cute colorful adventure with a number of puzzles and mini-games made by artists for anyone that considers games to be an art.\n\nEight unique & gorgeously hand crafted chapters await you. Hours and hours of game play will take you to a far away enchanting place.\n\nOur hero was spending summer happily at the cosy cottage until curiosity forced him to sample an unknown berry at the stream. Before he knew it, everything had become incredibly large, and he was reduced to the size of a bug!\nTrying to understand what happened and how to return things back to normal, we set off into the invisible to the human eye tiny world, where worms, beetles and spiders live their life, and build bizarre vehicles, in disguise so that humans do not realize.\nOur new friends will surely help us by discovering the secret healing potion, which will return us to our previous dimensions. All we need is to collect enough raspberries to cook grandmother's jam. And as we all know - this is a remedy for all ills!",
