    "description": "This is an action RPG released in Japan by Nihon Falcom in 1989. The subtitle 'WANDERERS FROM Ys' marks this installment as an ambitious project that incorporates new elements. The perspective has shifted from a 'half-top view' to a 'side view,' and the method of attack has changed from physical collisions to swinging a sword, allowing for a variety of actions.\n\nFurthermore, magic serves merely as a complement to combat and the outcome of battles relies on the player's skill. Adol's growth can be seen as a testament to one's own improvement.\n\nOf course, the concept of the Ys series as \"RPGs enjoyable for everyone\" remains intact. Alongside its engaging storyline, the game features beautiful background visuals with \"multi-scrolling\" and lively music, making it a finely crafted masterpiece down to the smallest details.\n\n*The main game and gallery screen (*Gallery) are in Japanese version.\n*Other menu screens and \"How to play\" screens are in English.",
