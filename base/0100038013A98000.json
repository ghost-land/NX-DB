    "description": "TOPOLON is a futuristic action puzzle game that challenges the nano-world.\n\nViruses have the habit of moving back and forth on wires that are strung across the circuitry.\nCollide and destroy viruses by attracting and splitting them up.\nViruses will continue to be generated indefinitely and, if left unattended, will transform into other forms.\nThe key to clearing a stage is the player's ability to make quick decisions and efficient operations.\n\nThere are three different game modes, three difficulty levels, and a random stage generation function.\nEnjoy this immortal masterpiece that once won the \"2005 Mobile Game of the Year\" award.\n\n■ About G-MODE Archives\nThe G-MODE Archives is a reissue project that faithfully recreates old feature phone games as they were back then.\n\nIn order to enjoy the app as it was back then, the web-connected menu, buttons, and keys have been transplanted, but some of them may not work.\nFor more information on the Nintendo Switch™ version, press + and - buttons and see the \"How to play\" in the PAUSE menu.\n\n■ Topolon\nRelease Year 2003 (G-mode)\nSite \"Get!!
