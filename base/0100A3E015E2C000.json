    "description": "MIYAMOTO is a beautifully styled Japanese-themed card game. Build your deck with cards earned after each battle, and strategically place unique pieces to claim victory.\n\nMasters like Yoichi, Hanzo, and the Yakuza can be unlocked by collecting battle coins. Pick from a randomly dealt hand and build your deck for each battle. Use your pieces' abilities wisely, such as the Kabuki, who can attack two spaces, the Shiba Inu, who buffs nearby allies, and the Princess, whose power grows with the number of allies.\n\nConstruct a powerful deck and defeat Miyamoto, who awaits at the final challenge!",
