    "description": "Blaze through the battlefield in style in your \"Crossbreed\" - a mech suit built jointly of human and alien technology. \n\nEverything is riding on you! The game features vertical-scrolling, side-scrolling, and rail-shooter perspectives all seamlessly integrated alongside each other in brilliantly laid out 2.5D visuals.\nThe ever-changing gameplay dynamic this creates represents an evolution in the shoot-'em-up genre that helps draw it into the modern era, but the skill level needed to dodge bullets and rout the opposition remains high.",
